"NEUROENDOCRINE CELL HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY (NEHI) IS A FORM OF CHILDHOOD INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY TACHYPNEA, RETRACTIONS, CRACKLES, AND HYPOXIA. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE CLINICAL AND TOMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF NEHI AND DISCUSS THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF THIS CONDITION. TWELVE FULL-TERM INFANTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH NEHI IN 2003�2011 BASED ON CLINICAL AND TOMOGRAPHIC FINDINGS. FOUR INFANTS WERE BIOPSIED
RECENT STUDIES HAVE DETECTED LOCAL CHANGES OF BRAIN GRAY MATTER AND WHITE MATTER IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT PAIN SYNDROMES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RELATED TO NEUROPLASTICITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN WHITE MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE, IN THE CORTICAL, AND SUBCORTICAL MORPHOMETRY IN PATIENTS WITH TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA (TN) USING ADVANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH TN (18 FEMALES AND SIX MALES) WITH MEAN AGE OF 55.8 � 8.5 YEARS AND 24 HEALTHY CONTROLS, MATCHED FOR AGE AND SEX, WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGES (DTI) AND 3D T1 IMAGES WERE ACQUIRED ON A 1.5 TESLA SCANNER. FOR DTI ANALYSIS WE USED THE TRACT-BASED SPATIAL STATISTICS (TBSS), WHICH ALLOWS THE IDENTIFICATION OF CHANGES IN FRACTIONAL ANISOTROPY (FA) IN THE MAJOR WHITE MATTER TRACTS. THE MEASUREMENT OF CORTICAL THICKNESS, SUBCORTICAL VOLUMETRY AS WELL AS THE COMPARISON BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CONTROLS WERE PERFORMED USING THE FREESURFER� SOFTWARE. NO DIFFUSIVITY ABNORMALITIES OF

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF T2 MAP FOR MYOCARDIAL IRON QUANTIFICATION IN PATIENTS WITH HEMOCHROMATOSIS AND CONTROLS. MYOCARDIAL CARDIOTOXICITY DUE TO IRON OVERLOAD IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG HEMOCHROMATOSIS PATIENTS. NON-INVASIVE MYOCARDIAL IRON QUANTIFICATION BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) HAS REVOLUTIONIZED PATIENT MANAGEMENT, AND IS ONE OF THE RARE CASES IN WHICH A DIAGNOSTIC TEST HAS BEEN PROVEN TO DIRECTLY DECREASE MORTALITY FROM A CERTAIN DISEASE. THIS OCCURS DUE TO DISSOCIATION BETWEEN SERUM LEVELS OF IRON, FERRITIN AND TRANSFERRIN AND THE MYOCARDIAL DEPOSITION OF IRON, MAKING THE DIRECT QUANTIFICATION OF MYOCARDIAL IRON OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. CARDIAC MR IS THE MOST ACURATE AND AVAILABLE WAY OF NON-INVASIVE MYOCARDIAL IRON OVERLOAD QUANTIFICATION. MYOCARDIAL IRON PRODUCES SMALL DISTORTIONS ON THE SURROUNDING MAGNETIC FIELD THAT MAY BE CAPTURED BY T2* WEIGHTED MR SEQUENCES. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN TESTED AND VALIDATED IN 1.5 TESLA MR SYSTEMS, BUT HAS IMPORTANT TECHNICAL LIMI

THE PROTECTION OF WORK IS A HISTORICAL CONSTRUCTION, IN A WORLD WIDE CONTEXT, OR IN BRAZIL. THE FIRST RULES RELATED TO LABOR ARE FROM THE XIX CENTURY. IT WAS ON THE XX CENTURY, HOWEVER, THAT LABOR LAW WAS FUNDED IN MOST NATIONS. THERE WERE MANY EVENTS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTEMPORARY LABOR LAW, FROM WHICH WE COULD HIGHLIGHT: THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF ORGANIZING THE WORK EXPERIENCED BY HUMANITY (SLAVERY, SERFDOM, GUILDS, INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION), THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL REGIMES, THE VERY EMERGE OF LABOR LAW AS AN AREA OF LAW ABLE TO PROTECT AND REGULATE THE ESTABLISHED RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AND THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL CONJECTURES EXPERIENCED ( THE POST-MODERN CONDITION, THE GLOBALIZATION, THE NEOLIBERALISM AND THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE RELATIONS). IN BRAZIL, THE EMERGENCE OF THE LABOR LAW WAS CONSIDERED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TWO IMPORTANT HISTORICAL FACTS IN BRAZILIAN'S POLITICAL SCENE: THE SLAVERY ABOLITION AND THE PROCLAMATION OF THE REPUBLIC.

THIS DISSERTATION EXAMINES THE WORK OF THE MINEIRO AUTHOR (SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN IN THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS). MILTON REZENDE AND HIS POETIC PROCESS. WE HAVE VERIFIED THAT INTERTEXTUALITY IS VERY RECURRENT IN HIS POETRY, SO AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF INTERTEXTUALITY HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOCUSING ON STUDIES OF BAKHTIN AND JULIA KRISTEVA. ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF THE POET IS TO USE HETERONYMS TO WRITE THE FOREWORD OF HIS BOOKS. WE CAN SEE THAT THE POEMS CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO SOME CORES THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED, AND WE HAVE CONDUCTED A STUDY FROM THIS CRITERION ON. MILTON WAS INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS AUTHORS SUCH AS AUGUSTO DOS ANJOS, CARLOS DRUMMOND DE ANDRADE, FERNANDO PESSOA AND �LVARES DE AZEVEDO, BUT HAS HIS OWN STYLE OF WRITING HIS POETRY. MILTON REZENDE IS AN HEIR OF OCCIDENTAL LITERATURE PRODUCED SO FAR. HIS POEMS USUALLY RE-READ A THEME HIGHLY ESTEEMED TO ROMANTICISM, DEATH. HIS FONDNESS FOR CEMETERIES, FUNERALS AND RITES OF DEATH IS COMBINED WITH AN APPROACH TO CONTEMPORARY THEMES AND A CRITICA

WITH THE START OF MODERNISM, THE CHRONICLE ACQUIRED NEW FORMS WHICH DIALOGUED WITH THE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY TENDENCIES OF THE PERIOD, WHEN NATIONALISM WAS FOUNDED ON THE PILLARS OF POPULAR CULTURE, DEALING WITH TOPICS LINKED TO THE BRAZILIAN REALITY AND WITH THE ADOPTION OF IDEOLOGICAL ENGAGEMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, FERNANDO SABINO BEGAN HIS LITERARY CAREER WITH A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES CALLED OS GRILOS N�O CANTAM MAIS. ON THIS OCCASION, THE NEW WRITER SENT THE BOOK TO ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE MODERNIST MOVEMENT IN BRAZIL, MARIO DE ANDRADE, ASKING HIM FOR SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE BOOKS. THE MODERNIST ANSWERED OFFERING VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE ON THIS FIRST BOOK OF SABINO AND FROM THIS POINT ON, THERE WAS A CONSTANT EXCHANGE OF CORRESPONDENCE BETW
THE OBJECT OF THIS THESIS IS TO ANALYZE THE THEMES OF MELANCHOLIA, DEATH, HUMOR, IRONY, AND EROTICISM IN THE WORKS OF MANUEL BANDEIRA, CHIEFLY A CINZA DAS HORAS, CARNAVAL, O RITMO DISSOLUTO E LIBERTINAGEM. IN HIS FIRST WORK, A CINZA DAS HORAS, THE POET INTERACTS INTENSELY WITH THE DISEASE THAT HAS ATTACKED HIM TUBERCULOSIS, CREATING POEMS IMPREGNATED WITH IMPRESSIONS OF DEATH, A THEME THAT MAKES ITSELF PRESENT IN MOST OF HIS WORK. IN PARTICULAR THE POEM �DISENCHANTMENT� WILL BE ANALYZED UNDER THIS PRISM. CARNAVAL, THE AUTHOR�S SECOND BOOK, DOES NOT OFFER A GREAT CHANGE EITHER IN ESTHETICS OR FORM, LARGELY CONTINUING THE THEMES OF THE FIRST. O RITMO DISSOLUTO EXHIBITS THE BEGINNINGS OF A TRANSITION, WITH SOME MODERNIST CHARACTERISTICS, BUT STILL EXHIBITS A SMOOTH STYLE. IN LIBERTINAGEM THE AUTHOR ENTERS A NEW PHASE. MANUEL BANDEIRA�S FORM OF WRITING BECOMES FREER AND HE APPROACHES HIS THEMES WITH IRONY AND HUMOR. �PNEUMOT�RAX� IS ONE OF THE POEMS ANALYZED HERE. EVEN AS HE TREATED HIS OWN TRAGEDY WITH IRONY, DE

THIS RESEARCH WAS BASED ON THE STUDY OF THEORIES AS INTERTEXTUAL LITERARY PHENOMENON. THIS APPROACH HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT THE WORKS DO NOT GO OFF IN ITS ORIGINAL SENSE, BUT COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER REGARDLESS OF THE INTERESTS OF WRITERS AND THE TIME THEY WERE WRITTEN. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF 65 YEARS BETWEEN THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THE CIDADE DO SONHO E DA MELANCOLIA, GILBERTO DE ALENCAR IN 1926, AND BOCA DE CHAFARIZ, RUI MOUR�O IN 1991, THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL TRADITIONS. THIS ANALYSIS INVOLVES THREE PHASES: THE FIRST GOES THROUGH THE THEORY OF MICRO AND MACRO ANALYSIS OF THE NARRATIVES, THE SECOND HOLDS IN THE COLLATION OF THE NOVELS, IN ORDER TO OBSERVE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE THIRD COMMON THEME BACK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OLD VILA RICA, TODAY OURO PRETO, AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL CONSTRUCTION OF MINAS GERAIS, THUS JUSTIFYING THE INTERDISCIPLINARITY THEME.

THIS RESEARCH IS ABOUT WALCYRMONTEIRO�S BOOK CALLED �VISAGENS E ASSOMBRA��ES DE BEL�M�.THE LITERARY WORK HAS A CURRENT ISSUE WITH EVERYDAY ACTIONS, SOMETIMES IT CAN BE EVEN VULGAR AND GROTESQUE. IT IS A CULTURAL AND LITERARY MASTERPIECE, PRODUCED THROUGH PROSE, THAT KEEPS POPULAR ORAL CULTURE REMNANTS. A CULTURAL STUDY OF THE BOOK WILL BE DONE, GIVING GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ITS ORAL ASPECTS AND ALSO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE MYTHIC TRADITION PERPETUATION. THERE WILL BE A REGIONAL CONTEXT APPROACH IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN MYTH AND LEGEND, GIVING EMPHASIS TO COMMENTS RELATED TO FOLKLORIC (POPULAR) ASPECTS IN THE NARRATIVE.
THIS DISSERTATION INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND LITERATURE, ELECTING THE BOOK CAPIT�ES DA AREIA (1937), BY JORGE AMADO, AS THE OBJECT OF ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ABANDONED AND EXCLUDED CHILDREN UNDER THE LEGISLATION FROM THE TIME IT WAS PUBLISHED, THE C�DIGO DE MENORES FROM 1926, IN PARALLEL TO THE CURRENT PROTECTION LAW, NAMELY ESTATUTO DA CRIAN�A E DO ADOLESCENTE, FROM 1990. STUDIES ON INTERDISCIPLINARITY BETWEEN THESE TWO FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE CONCENTRATED IN RESEARCHING LAW AS A NARRATIVE - CHECKING THE DISCURSIVE ASPECTS OF LEGAL TEXTS - OR LAW IN LITERATURE. THIS WORK FOCUSES ON THE LATTER, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY HOW LITERARY WORKS ACCOMMODATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF A LEGAL SYSTEM FROM A CERTAIN HISTORIC PERIOD. THUS, IT RELIES ON THE PREMISE THAT LITERATURE PROVIDES A GLIMPSE OF A CERTAIN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IN TURN IS THE SUBSTRATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW, WHICH AIMS AT ORDERING THE SOCIETY.

THIS RESEARCH TAKES OWNERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSE OF LITERATURE PRESENTED IN THE NOVEL BUDAPESTE (2003), BY CHICO BUARQUE THROUGH THE CONFLICTED RELATIONSHIP AS EXPERIENCED BY THE GHOSTWRITER JOSE COSTA BETWEEN ANONYMITY AND CONSECRATION, WHICH ALLOWS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE BETWEEN LITERATURE AND SOCIETY, BETWEEN FICTION AND REALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CULTURAL INDUSTRY. ADDRESSING THE THEME OF THE DOUBLE, THE AUTHOR REVEALS THE CONSTANT DILEMMA THAT PLAGUES THE CONTEMPORARY WRITER, INSERTED IN THE CONSUMER SOCIETY, IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. FROM THE DEFINITIONS OF POSTMODERNISM, CULTURAL IDENTITY AND DOUBLE THIS STUDY HAS THE PURPOSE TO VERIFY TO WHAT EXTENT THESE ISSUES ARE FORMULATED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOVEL. AND IF THE NOVEL CAN REPRESENT, METAPHORICALLY, THE SCENARIO EXPERIENCED BY BRAZILIAN WRITER IN THE CURRENT CONJUNCTURE.
"THIS WORK ANALYZES INTERTEXTUALITY IN THE POETRY OF AD�LIA PRADO POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS A STRIKING CHARACTERISTIC OF HER PROCESS OF CREATION. WE BASE OUR STUDY ON THOSE EPIGRAPHS TAKEN FROM THE HOLY BIBLE IN TWO OF HER BOOKS OF POETRY, BAGAGEM AND A DURA��O DO DIA, SHOWING HOW HER PROCESS OF CREATION WORKS WITHIN INTERTEXTUALITY. IN THIS ANALYSIS, THE INTERTEXTUAL DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY BIBLE IS EXAMINED SINCE THE POET USES TEXTS FROM THE HOLY BIBLE AS STARTING POINT FOR THE CREATION OF HER POETRY AND THE QUOTATIONS SHOW TO THE READER THE PATH THAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF HER POETRY. THE INTERTEXTUAL DIALOGUE WILL BE DETAILED SHOWING HOW THE POEMS AND THE EPIGRAPHS THAT PROCEED EACH CHAPTER OF THE BOOKS WHICH ARE STUDIED, INTERACT. AS A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE STUDY, THE FOLLOWING THEORIES OF INTERTEXTUALITY WILL BE USED: DIALOGISM AND INTERTEXT AS PRESENTED BY THE RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHER MIKHAIL BAKHTIN

THE POETIC PROSE MODERNIST A IDADE DO SERROTE, OF MURILO MENDES IS THE FOCUS OF THIS DISSERTATION. THE WORK IN QUESTION, THE POET THROUGH HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, RESCUES HER WALK TOWARD POETRY. THE WORK SHOWS THE TRAJECTORY OF THE AUTHOR FROM HIS CHILDHOOD IN THE CITY OF JUIZ DE FORA, WITH THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT AS A POET, POINTING THE RIPENING OF IT AND TAKING POETRY AS A SOCIAL ROLE. AS FOR THE STYLE USED BY THE POET TO WRITE HIS WORK WILL BE NOTED THAT USE OF POETIC PROSE. SHOW CHARACTERISTICS OF PROSE, POETRY AND POETIC PROSE IN THAT IT MERGES THE TWO STYLES. AS CAN BE SEEN, MURILO MENDES BELONGS TO THE MODERNIST LITERARY SCHOOL. FURTHERMORE, A IDADE DO SERROTE PRESENTS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY MOVEMENT SURREALIST. ANOTHER ISSUE TO BE FOCUS OF THIS DISSERTATION IS THE ROLE OF THE FEMALE FIGURE IN BOTH THE POET'S LIFE AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPLEX HUMAN UNIVERSE.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE WORK OF NOEL ROSA IN RESPECT OF ITS LITERARY-MUSICAL ASPECTS AND ANALYZES SOME OF HIS SONGS BASED ON STUDIES OF CHRISTOPHER TEZZA ON THE DESIGN OF POETRY BY RUSSIAN THEORIST MIKHAIL BAKHTIN, COMBINED WITH THE STUDIES OF CARLOS SANDRONI AND LUIZ TATIT THAT ARTICULATE MUSIC (MELODY, RHYTHM, INTERPRETATION) AND LYRICS. NOEL ROSA WORKED WITH THE TRANSFORMATION OF MUSICAL AND POETIC LANGUAGES, IN ORDER TO CONTEXTUALIZE THEM TO THE MODERNIZATION THAT EMERGED, WHOSE EFFECTS CONTRIBUTED TO CAUSE A CRITICAL PROCESS OF BRAZILIAN CULTURE. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER EXAMINES, UNDER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, THE AESTHETIC RENOVATION OF LANGUAGE OF SAMBA, PREDOMINANT GENRE IN THE WORK OF NOEL ROSA.
THIS DISSERTATION AIMED AT STUDYING THE PRESENCE OF A FEMININE SPEAKER IN SOME SONGS-POEMS BY CHICO BUARQUE DE HOLLANDA, BETWEEN 1960 AND 1980. IN THE PRODUCTION OF THOSE YEARS, A CONSTANT PRESENCE OF A FEMALE VOICE WAS OBSERVED, WHICH PROVOKED THE EMERGENCE OF THE PROBLEM TO BE INVESTIGATED: WHY THE FEMALE VOICE TOOK SUCH IMPORTANCE IN THAT IDIOSYNCRATIC PERIOD? THREE DISTINCT PATHWAYS GUIDED THE RESEARCH: THE FIRST ONE APPROACHES THE REPRESSOR ASPECT PROMOTED BY THE DICTATORIAL MOVEMENT IN THAT TIME. THE PRESENCE OF THE SPEAKER, IN THIS CASE, TRANSITS AMONG FEMALE VOICES WHICH MAY ONLY BE TALKING ABOUT LOVE OR SHARING THE DISCOURSE WITH MALE VOICES, LIKE METAPHORS THAT HID A REVOLUTIONARY AND QUESTING DISCOURSE TO BE INVESTIGATED. THE SECOND PATHWAY REVISITED THE TROUBADOUR CANTIGAS DE AMIGO, IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE FEMALE BEHAVIOR OF THE MEDIEVAL AND THE CHICO BUARQUE�S MUSES, SINCE THAT THE PRESENCE OF A FEMALE SPEAKER IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES WAS CON
THE IMPORTANCE OF SAMBA TO BRAZILIAN POPULAR MUSIC DUE TO ITS TRANSFORMATION INTO A NATIONAL MUSIC. THEREFORE, THE ANALYSIS OF BRAZILIAN POPULAR SONG, THE OBJECT OF STUDY OF SOME AUTHORS SHOWS THE SAMBA THAT EMERGED IN THE '30S AS A MAJOR MUSICAL GENRE IN THE COUNTRY, MAKING IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSTITUTION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY. AS PRESENTED IN THE INTRODUCTION, SEVERAL AUTHORS POINT ARY BARROSO AS ONE OF THE GREATEST COMPOSERS OF POPULAR MODERN AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING ABROAD SAMBA-EXALTATION AND MARCHING, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE BOSSA NOVA. IT ALSO STANDS OUT, ITS MULTIPLE FACETS AS SPORTSCASTER, WRITER, BROADCASTER, ALDERMAN. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE WORK OF ARY BARROSO, AS A COMPOSER, PARTICULARLY THE SAMBA-EXALTATION, A MUSICAL GENRE THAT HAS SOPHISTICATED FEATURES GREAT FEELING TO BRAZIL. ACCORDINGLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PRESENT AN ANALYSIS OF EXALTATION SAMBA COMPOSER ARY BARROSO, SHOWING TRACES OF EPIC ACCOUNT. THE SURVEY IS ALSO THE CONCEPTION OF MUSICAL EXALTATION SAMBA C
THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS A STUDY ON THE NOVEL MEM�RIAS SEM MAL�CIA DE GUDESTEU RODOVALHO, BY THE BRAZILIAN WRITER GILBERTO DE ALENCAR, FROM A DOCUMENTARY SET OF EXCHANGED LETTERS TO THE WRITER. THIS EPISTOLARY DIALOGUE WAS ENLARGED BY THE INCREASE OF THE MISSIVES OF COSETTE DE ALENCAR, WHO WAS A WRITER AND ALSO THE HOLDER'S DAUGHTER. THIS COLLECTION, STORED IN MUSEU DE ARTE MURILO MENDES (MAMM) IN JUIZ DE FORA, DEFINED TWO STREAMLINES OF INVESTIGATION: THE FIRST ONE WAS THE ELABORATION OF A NEW EDITION OF SOURCES OR ANNOTATED EDITION OF MISSIVES, WHICH WAS DONE TO COMMENT ON THE CHOSEN BOOK, AND THE SECOND ONE HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE CRITICISM OF THE SIGNATORIES, WHICH USED THE EPISTOLARY WRITING TO REFLECT UPON THE INTERTEXTUAL RELATION BETWEEN THE CITED BOOK AND THE BOOK O ATENEU, BY RAUL POMP�IA. TO DO SO, TWO THEORETICAL SOURCES WERE THE BASE OF THIS RESEARCH: THE INTERTEXTUALITY, RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF THE DEVELOPED STUDIES, AND THE GENETIC CRITICISM, WHICH POINTED OUT THE OTHER PART OF THE RECORDS, ALLOWIN
THE PRESENT DISSERTATION ADDRESSES THE NOVEL UM COPO DE C�LERA, BY RADUAN NASSAR, A NARRATIVE OF LIFE OF A COUPLE WHOSE RELATIONSHIP IS APPARENTLY HARMONIOUS, UNTIL A TRIVIAL EVENT, THE DESTRUCTION OF A HEDGE BY SAUBA ANTS, TRIGGERS THE NARRATOR�S RAGE, WITH AN INTENSE VERBAL ATTACK BETWEEN THEM, RESULTING IN THE END OF THE RELATION AND DIVORCE, FOR A SHORT TIME. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS NECESSARY TO COLLATE AS THE OBJECT OF ANALYSIS OF THIS STUDY THE PASSION DISCURSIVIZATION INTERLACED WITH THE CHOLERA USED BY THE UNNAMED CHARACTERS (HE AND SHE), AND THE RELEVANCE OF THE HOLE CAUSED BY THE ANTS IN THE HEDGE BEING USED AS A METAPHOR, ASSOCIATING THE INVASION OF THE PROTAGONIST �HE� IN HER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL WORLD, WHICH IS SUGGESTED AND POKED BY HIS PARTNER. THE NARRATIVITY OF THIS LOVE STORY CREATED BY RADUAN CONFRONTS ITSELF IN THE LOVERS� CONFLICT, WITH A LANGUAGE THAT GOES FROM ERUDITE TO COLLOQUIAL AND VULGAR TERMS, DESCRIBING THE POWER DISPUTE, THE EXISTENTIAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DISCOURSES BETWEEN T
THIS RESEARCH HAS THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING THE CONTEMPORARY CRIME NOVEL AS A BRAZILIAN LITERARY GENRE NATIONAL, FOCUSING THE WHOLE WORK OF THE PSYCHOANALYST AND WRITER LUIZ ALFREDO GARCIA-ROZA, BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 1996 TO 2012, YEARS OF THEIR FIRST AND LAST PUBLICATIONS.WE WILL TAKE AS A THEORETICAL GUIDETHE PRESENTATION OF THE DETECTIVE NOVEL AS A GENRE, ITS ORIGINS AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS. THEN THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICIAL LITERATURE ON NATIONAL SOIL, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONTEMPORARY PRODUCTION. THE WORK OF LUIZ ALFREDO GARCIA-ROZA, WITH A SEQUENCE OF TEN TITLES IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, LETS FORM A SUFFICIENT SET FOR THE EFFECT OF THEORY AND LITERARY CRITICISM. THE MAIN FOCUS IS THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SAME SET IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND TO THE CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN LITERATURE.THE RELEVANT THEORETICAL ISSUES ARE SOME THAT HAVE GUIDED THE GLOBAL LITERARY THEORY AND CRITICISM: WHAT IS LITERATURE? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LITERATURE AND THE AUTHOR? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LITERATURE AND

"THIS PAPER AIMS A HYPOTHESIS THAT IS CAPABLE TO JUSTIFY THE UNSTABLE ENDURANCE OF THE NARRATIVE FORM USED BY AVELINO F�SCOLO REGARDING THE LITERARY MOVEMENTS KNOWN AS REALISM/NATURALISM AS GENRE IN HIS LITERARY WORK MORRO VELHO (1999), USING THE DERRIDA'S CONCEPT OF SPECTER ACCORDING TO HIS CONFERENCE ""SPECTERS OF MARX"" (1994) WHICH WAS LECTURED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN 1993, BEING PUBLISHED AFTERWARDS. STARTING FROM THE LATE CLASSIFICATION GIVEN TO THE NOVEL AS BEING ATTACHED TO THE LATE NATURALISM ASSOCIATED TO SOCIAL PROTEST NOVEL AND TO A LITERARY FORMULA CONSIDERED AS OVERUSED, THIS PAPER WILL APPROACH HISTORICAL, SOCIAL AND LITERARY ASPECTS THAT ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF THE RECURRENCE OF THIS ARTISTIC MOVEMENT IN 1940. THEREUNTO, THIS LITERARY ANALYSIS WILL INVESTIGATE THE WIDE RANGE OF DENOMINATIONS THAT IS PERTINENT TO NATURALISM IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, PATTERNS AND EPOCHS, WHICH CAN ALSO BE OBSERVED IN DIVERSE MOMENTS IN BRAZILIAN LITERATURE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FACTORS THAT"
THIS WORK INTENDS TO MAKE A JOURNEY THROUGH THE NARRATIVE OF THE WRITER CAIO FERNANDO ABREU, SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT, ALTHOUGH HE IS AN AUTHOR OF MULTIPLE INFLUENCES AND HAS A MULTIFACETED PRODUCTION, PROVIDING US SEVERAL PERSPECTIVES OF STUDY, HIS WORK ALSO HAS SUSTAIN ELEMENTS THAT CONDUCT THE READING. CAIO FERNANDO ABREU WAS A WRITER SURROUNDED BY THE SPIRIT OF HIS TIME, AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS DIRECTLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS LITERATURE. THE AUTHOR LIVED INTENSELY EACH PHASE OF HIS LIFE, ENJOYING DIVERSE EXPERIENCES OF HIS TIME, HE WAS HIPPIE, ASTROLOGER, ACTOR, WRITER, JOURNALIST, POET, MILITANT, HE TRIED VARIOUS DRUGS AND ALSO HAD MANY LOVERS. HE WAS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL EXPERIENCES THAT LIFE WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM AND PART OF EACH OF THEM WAS REGISTERED IN HIS WRITINGS. THUS, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WRITER�S PRODUCTION CAN BE READ AS A LITERATURE THAT CONVEYS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SUBJECT OR OF A GENERATION TOWARDS THE SOCIOCULTURAL MODIFICATIONS OF HIS
THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE IMAGINARY, THE UPDATE OF MYTH AND THE LITERARY WORK IN OS DOZE TRABALHOS DE H�RCULES, BY MONTEIRO LOBATO. THE THEORIC SUPPORT CHOSEN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORK IS FOUND IN MYTH CONCEPTION PRESENTED BY JOSEPH CAMPBELL, IN THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL STRUCTURES OF THE IMAGINARY BY GILBERT DURAND AND IN THE LANGUAGE CONCEPTION OF MARTIN HEIDEGGER. THE MYTH, IMAGINARY AND LANGUAGE ARE RELATED VERY CLOSE, SINCE THE FACULTY OF SPEECH DIFFERENTIATES MAN FROM OTHER MAN AND ANIMALS, BECOMING HIM AN UNIQUE BEING IN THE WORLD. MYTHS DELINEATE STANDARDS FOR EXISTENTIAL WALK THROUGH THE IMAGINARY DIMENSION. THE IMAGINARY IS PRESENTED AS A DYNAMISM THAT ORGANIZE CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND A MATRIX OF RATIONAL THOUGHT. THE LANGUAGE IN THE EXISTENTIAL-ONTOLOGICAL SENSE FINDS FOUNDATION IN SPEECH AND THIS ARTICULATES THE COMPREHENSIBILITY OF BEING IN THE WORLD. THE LITERATURE, IN TURN, IS SEEN AS THE PECULIAR LANGUAGE THAT THEMATIZES UNIQUELY INQUIRIES, UTOPIAS AND HUMAN C
STUDYING THE NOVEL LUC�OLA, BY JOS� DE ALENCAR, PUBLISHED IN 1862, AND THE FILM LUC�OLA, O ANJO PECADOR (THE SINFUL ANGEL), BY ALFREDO STERNHEIM, RELEASED IN 1975, THIS DISSERTATION PROPOSES TO RESEARCH AN APPROACH TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROTAGONIST OF THE WORKS THROUGH THEIR CLOTHING, IN THE NOVEL, AND THROUGH THEIR COSTUMES, IN THE FILM. THIS IS NOT A STUDY ABOUT FASHION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THROUGH LITERATURE, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS A STUDY ABOUT A DESIRE TO ANALYZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FASHION TO LITERATURE AND HOW WE SITUATE THIS DIALOGUE WITHIN THE LITERARY NARRATIVE. ANCHORED IN THE DESCRIPTIONS OF CLOTHING PRESENT IN ALENCAR'S NOVEL, THE FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH IS DIRECTED TO A SURVEY OF THE GARMENT AS TEXT (WRITTEN AND VISUAL), AND AS SUCH, TO INVESTIGATE THE ATTENTION GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR AND THE FILM DIRECTOR TO THIS COMPONENT OF LANGUAGE. IN DEVELOPING A PLATFORM OF STUDY GUIDED BY THE INTERFACE BETWEEN LITERATURE AND CINEMA, IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF COSTUME
THIS STUDY PRESENTS METAMORPHOSIS AS A THEMATIC AND METALINGUISTIC ELEMENT IN THE SHORT STORIES OF MURILO RUBI�O. IT AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FRAGMENTATION OF PERSONALITY OF THE MODERN MAN IN THE SHORT STORIES: O EX-M�GICO DA TABERNA MINHOTA, O PIROT�CNICO ZACARIAS, OS DRAG�ES, TELECO, O COELHINHO E ALFREDO WHOSE THEMES MANIFEST THE FABLE OF METAMORPHOSIS. THESE TALES ALSO REVEAL INTERNAL FEATURES OF THE WORK OF THE WRITER SUCH AS THE REWRITING OF THE TALES, EPIGRAPHIC INTERTEXTUALITY AND CYCLICAL WRITING. UNDER THE VEIL OF THE FANTASTIC, THE SHORT STORIES REVEAL EXISTENTIAL REFLECTIONS WITH WHICH READERS CAN IDENTIFY. THROUGH THE INDIFFERENCE AND STAGNATION OF SOME CHARACTERS OF THE TALES, THEY REVEAL THE RELUCTANCE OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE FANTASTIC IS A TYPE OF LITERATURE THAT CAN ALLOW FOR A CRITICAL STANCE TOWARDS EVENTS.

"FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE SHORT STORY ""ROMANCE NEGRO"" BY RUBEN FONSECA, SHALL BE DONE A SURVEY OF THE PRESENCE OF THE DOUBLE, RECURRENT THEME IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN LITERATURE. FOLLOWING WILL BE THE EVOLUTION OF THIS SUBJECT FROM THE ORIGIN, FROM MYTH TO PSYCHOANALYSIS UNTIL IT REACHES ITS MANIFESTATION IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE. THEN, THERE WILL BE A RESEARCH ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE NARRATIVE AND THE POLICE INVERSION THEOREM PROPOSED BY RUBEM FONSECA TO DECONSTRUCT TRADITIONAL ROMANCE CLASSIC. FINALLY, IT WILL ANALYZE THE TRAJECTORY OF JOHN LANDERS: A MURDERER, A DECEIVER AND A TRAGIC HERO. THE STORY OF A PERFECT MURDER, WHICH OCCURRED ON THE SIDELINES OF A CONGRESS OF LITERATURE, INVOLVES THE READER, WHO, THROUGH THE SUSPENSE WILL BE ACQUAINTING THE SCENES OF CRIME. THE NARRATOR USES THE METALANGUAGE, THE GAME BETWEEN REALITY AND FICTION, THE UNVEILING OF SECRETS THAT LEAD THE READER FORWARD. FINALLY, WE SHALL SHOW THAT BY ANNIHILATING THE DOUBLE THE NARRATOR KILLS HIMSELF, BRINGING AS A RESULT THE GROWTH"
AN APPARENT TREND IN ORGANIZATIONS TODAY IS THE NEED TO ADAPT THEIR SOFTWARE PROCESSES TO ENABLE THE INCLUSION OF AGILE PRACTICES. AGILE METHODS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES AIMING AT CIRCUMVENT PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS TO EXECUTE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES OF THE SOFTWARE CYCLE. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE INVESTIGATED IS THE STRATEGY USED BY COMPANIES TO RECONCILE TO ADAPT THEIR SOFTWARE PROCESS TO AGILE METHODS. THE SPECIALIZATION OF STANDARD SOFTWARE PROCESS IS A VIABLE OPTION. THIS WORK PROPOSES AN AGILE SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE PROCESS FOR A BRAZILIAN PUBLIC COMPANY. ASSUMPTIONS WERE CONSIDERED TO THE FORMULATION OF THE PROPOSED PROCESS. THE FIRST IS THAT SHOULD FOLLOW SCRUM PRINCIPLES. THE SECOND IS THAT IT SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE LEVEL G OF THE MR-MPS-SW. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THIS WORK CAN BE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING BENEFITS IN AGILE SOFTWARE PROCESSES.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE IN THE NOVEL AND IN THE ADAPTATION TO THE SOAP NOVEL, THE CHARACTER RISOLETA, WHO WORKS IN CABARET BATACLAN, FROM THE COSTUMES OF THE CHARACTER, ADDRESSING HER TRANSFORMATION FROM PERIPHERAL CHARACTER IN THE LITERARY CONDITION TO AN ANTAGONIST IN THE SOAP NOVEL. IN LITERARY WORK, THE CABARET IS A SPACE OF TRANSGRESSION, WHERE AS IN THE SOAP NOVEL, WAS REPRESENTED AS A FLOWING AND RELAXED PLACE, SERVING AS A COUNTERPOINT TO THE CONFLICTS OF THE PLOT. THERE BY, IT OPERATED A REDEFINITION OF COMPOSITIONAL ELEMENTS OF SPACE. IN OUR ANALYSIS, WHICH WILL BE BASED ON SEMIOTICS THEORY OR INTERSEMIOTICS TRANSLATION, WE UNDERTAKE A FORAY INTO THE WORLD OF CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES WORN BY WOMEN IN THE CABARET BATACLAN, AIMING TO UNDERSTAND THEM AS

INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS BASED ON MULTIPLE VIEWS (MVIES) HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF A WIDE RANGE OF DATA TYPES. THESE ENVIRONMENTS PROVIDE VISUALIZATION MECHANISMS STRONGLY BASED ON INTERACTION IN ORDER TO SUPPORT USERS TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE DATA SETS. THESE ENVIRONMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE VISUALIZATION. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ENVIRONMENTS IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK. THEY OFTEN USE SOPHISTICATED COORDINATION MECHANISMS AND VISUALIZATION, HINDERING ITS DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, THE LACK OF RESOURCES FOR INTEGRATION BETWEEN ITS COMPONENTS AND THEIR REUSE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ADAPT THESE ENVIRONMENTS TO DOMAINS THAT ARE DIFFERENT IF CONSIDERED THE ORIGINAL ONE. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A TOOLKIT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MVIES. THE AIM OF THE TOOLKIT IS TO PROVIDE A BASIC STRUCTURE FROM WHICH PROGRAMMERS CAN DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUDE NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES. IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED TOOLKIT, TWO STUDIES WERE CREATE
THE DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (DSD) BECAME A COMMON APPROACH IN SOFTWARE ENGINEER AREA, WHILE AGILE METHODS HAVE BEEN POPULARIZED AMONG SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES. DUE TO THIS FACT, SOME ATTEMPTS TO JOIN THESE TWO APPROACHES WERE DONE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS AND EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT TRUST IN WORK�S QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTED PEOPLE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DDS APPROACH AND THAT IT REQUIRES MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES THE USE OF REPUTATION SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF DISTRIBUTED PAIR PROGRAMMING. THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM, WHICH IS WIDELY USED IN SUPPORTING BUILDING OF TRUST BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, CAN HELP IN THE TREATMENT OF THIS ISSUE AMONG UNKNOWN DEVELOPERS WORKING IN DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BASED ON AGILE METHODS. IN THIS RESEARCH CONTEXT, A SOLUTION NAMED SAROSRS WAS DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED. MOREOVER, CASE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED AND RESULTS ARE PRESENTED.
WHEAT IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE SUPPLY TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY, MAINLY CONSUMED IN THE FORM OF Y-PRODUCTS, BREADS, PASTA, CAKES AND BISCUITS. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT IN THE COMMODITY MARKET, WHICH SELECTS CULTIVARS OF HIGH YIELD POTENTIAL AND MEETS INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS. THE POTENTIAL YIELD, INDUSTRIAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE SEED INDUSTRY ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANTS, CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, SOIL, CROP MANAGEMENT, HARVESTING POINT AND STORAGE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE AGRONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL POTENTIAL AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF SEEDS OF WHEAT CULTIVARS OF DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL GRADES PRODUCED IN TWO WHEAT GROWING REGIONS OF THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN CACHOEIRA DO SUL (WHEAT GROWING REGION II) AND J�LIO DE CASTILHOS (WHEAT GROWING REGION I).

MANY UNCERTAIN EVENTS, NAMED RISKS, CAN OCCUR DURING PROJECTS DEVELOPMENT, GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES OR THREATS TO THEIR GOALS. AS IN OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS, SOFTWARE PROJECTS ARE ALSO PRONE TO THEM. IN A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, BEYOND PROJECT RISKS, OTHER RISKS REFERRING TO COLLABORATIVE WORK CAN ALSO BE GENERATED. IN THIS SENSE, THE PROJECT AND COLLABORATION RISKS, AS WELL AS THEIR IMPACTS, CAN BE DETERMINED FROM A SET OF CONTEXT ELEMENTS IN WHICH THE PROJECT IS DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS, THE PHASE INFORMATION OF THE SOFTWARE LIFE CYCLE. COLLABORATION RISKS CAN ALSO BE GENERATED ON THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED WITH PROJECT RISKS. THE WEB-BASED GROUPWARE ON PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (WGPMS) IS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT AIMS TO SUPPORT THE COLLABORATIVE PROJECT ACTIVITIES. AMONG ITS MODULES, THE MODULE THAT TREATS THE RISK MANAGEMENT (RISYS) AIMS TO PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS RISKS OF A PROJECT. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLLABORATION AND PROJECT

THIS WORK PRESENTS A STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF THE FULL-BRIDGE BIDIRECTIONAL DC CONVERTER AS A BATTERY BANK CHARGER IN A DC BUS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SEASONAL AND DO NOT OFFER A CONTINUOUSLY POWER SUPPLY. THUS, THE USE OF A BATTERY BANK CONNECTED TO A DC BUS SHARED WITH OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES BRINGS CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONTINUITY OF POWER SUPPLY. THE CONVERTER PROPOSED IN THIS WORK AIMS TO CONNECT THE BATTERY BANK TO THE DC BUS AT THE SAME TIME IT INTEGRATES THE CHARGING AND DISCHARGING MODES INTO A SINGLE CONVERTER. ADDITIONALLY, TO REDUCE THE VOLUME, IT IS USED A PLANAR TRANSFORMER THAT PROVIDES HIGH EFFICIENCY (UP TO 99.5%) AND A REDUCED VOLUME/POWER RATIO. THE CONVERTER IS DESIGNED TO CHARGE A BANK OF BATTERIES OF 192V. AT THE DISCHARGE MODE, IT IS DESIGNED TO FEED A 400V DC BUS WITH MAXIMUM POWER OF 1.34 KW. DESPITE THE USE OF THE FULL-BRIDGE CONVERTER IS NOT NEW IN THESE TYPES OF APPLICATION, TWO FACTORS SERVED AS MOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK: THE USE OF
THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A NEW CONTROL METHOD FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT DRIVE OF INDUCTION MOTORS. THIS TECHNIQUE USES A LOSS MODEL AND A CONTROL STRUCTURE BASED ON MINIMUM POWER CONSUMPTION. AT FIRST, STUDIES WITH THE MAIN ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONTROLLERS IN THE LAST DECADE ARE PRESENTED. THEN, THE ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL MODELS OF THREE-PHASE INDUCTION MOTOR ARE PRESENTED, FROM THE CLASSIC MODEL, WITH THE REFERENCE AXIS QD0. THE CONTROLLER USED IS AN INDIRECT FIELD-ORIENTED CONTROL (IFOC - INDIRECT FIELD ORIENTED CONTROL), COMPOSED OF AN OUTER CONTROL LOOP SPEED AND FLOW, AND AN INTERNAL CONTROL LOOP CURRENTS, WHICH SHOW A GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR SPEED AND TORQUE . BECAUSE IT IS A IFOC CONTROLLER, WHERE THE MOTOR PARAMETERS KNOWLEDGE ARE CRUCIAL FOR GOOD RESULTS, TESTING OF INDUCTION MOTOR IS CARRIED OUT AND PRESENTED. KNOWING MAJOR SOURCE OF LOSS OF MOTOR, CONTROLLER ENERGY EFFICIENCY CAN BE MADE.

DISSERTATION � ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING GRADUATE PROGRAM, FEDERAL TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF PARAN�, PATO BRANCO, BRAZIL, 2013. THIS WORK AIMS TO STUDY THE STATIC EXCITER THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF THE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT RIO JORD�O (UHEDRJ) USING FIBER BRAGG GRATINGS AS TEMPERATURE SENSOR. THE COMPONENTS OF THE STATIC EXCITER ARE PRESENTED, WITH A FOCUS ON THREE-PHASE THYRISTOR CONTROLLED BRIDGE RECTIFIER. THE CALIBRATION ALLOWS KNOWING THE ERRORS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF THE SENSORS AND THE GREATEST UNCERTAINTY CONTRIBUTIONS DUE TO DISPERSION OF THE SAMPLES AND ADJUSTING THE CURVES BY THE METHOD OF MINIMUN SQUARES. THE STATIC EXCITER INSTRUMENTATION ALLOWS PERFORMED THE TESTS IN VARIOUS OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE GENERATING UNIT: STARTING UNIT, EXCITATION EMPTY (WITH THE GENERATOR ENERGIZED BUT NOT CONNECTED TO THE GRID)
THE SHORT DURATION VOLTAGE VARIATIONS ARE TYPICAL DISTURBANCES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE POWER QUALITY IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. THE TYPICAL DEVICES FOR VOLTAGE SUPPORT AND REGULATION, DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS, ARE GENERALLY NOT CAPABLE OF MITIGATING SHORT DURATION VOLTAGE VARIATIONS. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED GENERATION UNITS CONNECTED TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH SUITABLE CONTROL STRATEGIES, CAN BE ABLE TO MITIGATE SHORT DURATION VOLTAGE VARIATIONS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE MITIGATION OF SHORT DURATION VOLTAGE VARIATIONS BY USING WIND POWER GENERATING UNITS BASED ON PERMANENTMAGNET SYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR (PMSG) CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK BY STATIC POWER CONVERTER. THE VOLTAGE VARIATION MITIGATION IS PERFORMED BY MEANS OF A SUPPLEMENTARY CONTROL LOOP ADDED TO THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL OF THE GRID-SIDE CONVERTER. THE PROPOSED CONTROL STRATEGY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE OVERLOAD CAPABILITY OF THE WIND GENERATION UNIT AND IT ISABLE TO MITIGATE SHORT DURATION VOLTAGE V
THE SPIZAETUS GENUS COMPRISES MEDIUM TO LARGE SIZED HAWKS,WHICH INHABIT TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL FORESTS. FOUR SPECIES ARE DESCRIBED: SPIZAETUS TYRANNUS, SPIZAETUS MELANOLEUCUS, SPIZAETUS ORNATUS AND SPIZAETUS ISIDORI, ALL OF WHICH ARE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE NEOTROPICAL REGION. MOST SPECIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OF LITTLE CONCERN BY THE IUCN, HOWEVER, THE GENUS HAS BECOME EXTREMELY RARE OUTSIDE THE AMAZON RAINFOREST DUE TO THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS HABITAT, REQUIRING MORE AND MORE STUDIES TO IDENTIFY CHANGES IN POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THOSE SPECIES AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAXONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES WITHIN THE GENUS, DESCRIPTION OF SUBSPECIES IN SPIZAETUS TYRANNUS AND SPIZAETUS ORNATUS. IN THE LAST YEARS, THE MICROSATELLITE-TYPE MARKERS HAVE BEEN THE MOST USED MOLECULAR TOOL IN ECOLOGICAL, GENETIC AND CONSERVATIONIST STUDIES, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THEIR ABUNDANCE AND HIGH POLYMORPHISM.

THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE WITHIN THE STUDIES OF SOCIETY AND NATURE RELATIONS, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER CONTEMPORARY ISSUES THAT EMERGE FROM THEM, IS BEING OUTLINED AS A MORE ADEQUATE WAY TO REFLECT THE SUBJECT IN ORDER TO GUIDE AND ARTICULATE SCIENCES TOWARDS A DEEP AND CONSTANT DIALOGUE TO ADDRESS THE DEMAND OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, JUST BY TRANSCENDING THE REINTEGRATION OF KNOWLEDGE, OF THE EXISTING AREAS OF KNOWLEDGE UP TO NOW, BOTH PLURI AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY. THE EFFORT TO INTEGRATE KNOWLEDGE INTERDISCIPLINARLY ARISES TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT THE DISCIPLINES ALONE CANNOT COMPLY WITH DUE TO AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND HYBRID REALITY AND DUE TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED. THUS, NEW PARADIGMS, SUCH AS THE COMPLEXITY, ARISE TO BRING EXPERTS AND THEIR DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE TO A TERRITORY WHERE THEY CAN SHARE THEIR CONCEPTS, THEORIES, AND METHODS.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGIES WERE MEDIATED BY ADSORPTION PROCESSES IN BATCH AND CONTINUOUS FLOW COLUMN,WHICH USED THE DRY BIOMASS OF AQUATIC PLANTS (SALVINIASP), SHELLS OF SHELLFISH (ANOMALOCARDIA BRASILIANA) AND ACTIVATED CARBON FROM COCONUT SHELL AS ADSORBENTSUBSTRATES.THE WASTEWATER AVAILABLE FOR REUSE WAS FIRST CATEGORIZEDIN ORDER TO ENABLE THE SUBSEQUENT METHODOLOGICAL PLAN FOCUSED ON A QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, INVESTIGATIVE, CORRELATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT STUDY.THE RESEARCH FOUND SATISFACTORY RESULTS FOR NITRATE (NO3-) AND ALUMINUM (AL+3) RE
THE POLYURETHANE IS A POLYMER THAT, ANNUALLY, HAS BEEN SHOWING A CONSTANT GROWTH IN ITS WORLDWIDE DEMAND. DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2000 TO 2010 ITS CONSUMPTION HAS INCREASED 70%, REPRESENTING A WORLDWIDE CONSUMPTION OF 16,9 MILLION TONS IN 2010. THIS CONSTANT GROWING VOLUME IS DUE TO ITS GREAT VERSATILITY FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IN SEVERAL SEGMENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH COMMERCIAL SUCCESS, THE GENERATION OF POLYURETHANE WASTE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THIS INCREASE, CAUSING SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS SUCH AS WASTE DISCHARGE AT SANITARY AND INDUSTRIAL LANDFILLS AND THE UTILIZATION OF NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES LIKE OIL INDUSTRY BYPRODUCTS. THIS WORK�S OBJECTIVES WERE TO EVALUATE, ECONOMICALLY, A RECYCLING PROCESS FOR POLYURETHANE WASTE THROUGH QUANTIFICATION, CLASSIFICATION AND APPRECIATIONS OF RAW MATERIAL PRICES, CONTAINED WITHIN THE GENERATED WASTE, BESIDES ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CAUSED.

THE THEORY OF COMPLEXITY BASICALLY COMES FROM THE IDEA THAT EVERY SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX UNIT HOLDING DIVERSITY AND MULTIPLICITY, EVEN ANTAGONISMS. THE ECOSYSTEM AND BIOSPHERE GIVE FULL MEANING TO THE TERM COMPLEX, WHICH MEANS INTERLACING, THEREFORE, WHAT IS INTERLACED TOGETHER, IT CONSISTS OF A CLOSELY WOVEN TOGETHER FABRIC, ALTHOUGH THE WIRES THAT CONSTITUTE ARE EXTREMELY DIVERSE. THE LIVING COMPLEXITY IS THE ORGANIZED DIVERSITY AND IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY EXTREME UNIT AND THE EXTREME LACK OF UNITY. HOWEVER, FROM THE REPRODUCTION IT IS PRESENT THE IDEA OF SPLITTING AS A RESULT OF IT, BECAUSE THE DIVERSITIES, MORFOG�NESES, ETC. CONTINUE. THE SOURCES OF DISORDER THAT AFFECT THE LIVING EXISTENCES ARE NUMEROUS AND UNINTERRUPTED, AS WELL AS THEY ARE INTERNAL. AS THE LIVING ORGANIZATION IS THERMAL AND ITS WORK PRODUCES HEAT, THE SAME ORGANIZATION IS BUILT IN THE CONDITIONS OF ITS OWN DESTRUCTION.

"OVER THE PAST DECADES, RESEARCHES ABOUT VEGETATION REMAININGS OF THE COASTAL SAND PLAINS ARE BEING INTENSIFIED, BUT THE ASPECTS RELATED TO NATURAL REGENERATION OF THIS COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN LOW INVESTIGATED. THE CLUSIA SCRUB (CS) IN THE RESTINGA DE JURUBATIBA CONSISTS OF VEGETATION ISLANDS DISTRIBUTED IN A MATRIX OF LOW VEGETATION COVER, WHERE NURSE PLANTS IMPROVE THE RECRUITMENT OF NEW INDIVIDUALS AND ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCRUB IN A KIND OF CYCLIC SUCCESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE SECONDARY SUCCESSION OF CS, DESCRIBING SPATIAL AND FLORISTIC PATTERNS OF WOODY PLANTS ON REGENERATING VEGETATION. THE REGENERATING VEGETATION WAS COMPARED WITH THE VEGETATION OF CONSERVED AREAS IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE PROCESSES THAT MAY DRIVE THE SECONDARY SUCCESSION AFTER THE DISTURBANCE. CONSERVED CS AREAS HAVE SPECIES THAT COLONIZE AREAS AFTER DISTURBANCE
INTRODU��O: NOS �LTIMOS ANOS, VEM-SE OBSERVANDO UM IMPORTANTE AUMENTO NA PREVAL�NCIA DA OBESIDADE EM DIVERSOS PA�SES E EM VARIADAS FAIXAS ET�RIAS, INCLUSIVE A PEDI�TRICA.

POR SER A OBESIDADE UMA DOEN�A CR�NICA, �NFASE ESPECIAL DEVE SER DADA �S MEDIDAS PREVENTIVAS. A PR�TICA DO ALEITAMENTO MATERNO PODE SER CONSIDERADA A INICIATIVA MAIS IMPORTANTE ENTRE TODAS QUANDO O ASSUNTO � PREVEN��O DE OBESIDADE. OBJETIVOS: AVALIAR A ASSOCIA��O ENTRE O EFEITO PROTETOR DO ALEITAMENTO MATERNO EXCLUSIVO AT� O 6� M�S QUANTO AO APARECIMENTO DA OBESIDADE INFANTIL. MATERIAL E M�TODOS: ESTUDO TRANSVERSAL ENVOLVENDO 460 CRIAN�AS MATRICULADAS EM 3 ESCOLAS PARTICULARES NO MUNIC�PIO DE SANTOS, SP REALIZADO, NOS MESES DE MAIO E JUNHO DE 2012.

DENTRE AS HORTALI�AS FOLHOSAS A ALFACE SE DESTACA ENTRE AS MAIS CONSUMIDAS PELOS BRASILEIROS, SENDO ASSIM, H� NECESSIDADE DE BUSCAR ALTERNATIVAS DE PRODUZI-LA UTILIZANDO TECNOLOGIAS MAIS SUSTENT�VEIS. MUITOS PRODUTORES QUE CULTIVAM EM SISTEMAS ORG�NICOS J� UTILIZAM BIOFERTILIZANTES COM RESULTADOS SATISFAT�RIOS. ENTRETANTO, PARA CONFIRMA��O E ENTENDIMENTO DOS SEUS EFEITOS CARECE DE MAIOR APROFUNDAMENTO CIENT�FICO. OBJETIVOU-SE COM ESSA PESQUISA AVALIAR O EFEITO DE DIFERENTES TIPOS DE BIOFERTILIZANTES NA PRODU��O E NUTRI��O DA ALFACE BABA DE VER�O EM SISTEMA ORG�NICO DE PRODU��O. O EXPERIMENTO FOI CONDUZIDO EM CONDI��ES DE CAMPO, NO SITIO HAVANA, MUNIC�PIO DE MONTANHA, ESP�RITO SANTO. FORAM CONDUZIDOS 02 (DOIS) EXPERIMENTOS: O PRIMEIRO, EM BLOCOS CASUALIZADOS COM QUATRO REPETI��ES, TESTANDO SEIS CONCENTRA��ES DO BIOFERTILIZANTE URINA DE VACA DILU�DA EM �GUA (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 E 25 %), SEGUNDO ENSAIO EXPERIMENTAL, CONDUZIDO EM ESQUEMA FATORIAL 2X5, FORAM TESTADAS A INOCULA��O DO SOLO COM MICROORGANISMOS EFICIENTE
THE USUAL TREATMENT TO SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS IS TO CONSIDER GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS. BUT THIS ASSUMPTION IS OFTEN NOT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE SAMPLE MAY HAVE OUTLIERS OR ASYMMETRY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE MODELS THAT DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF VARIABLES IN A MORE REALISTIC WAY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, DON'T GENERATE A VERY HIGH COMPUTATIONAL COST. BEARING THIS IN MIND, IT IS KNOWN THAT NON-GAUSSIAN MODELS OFFER MORE FLEXIBILITY , AND MAKE THE MODEL MORE REALISTIC, BUT THE COMPUTATIONAL COST OF THIS TYPE OF MODELS IS TOO LARGE. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS TO REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL COST IN GAUSSIAN MODELS. AMONG THESE METHODS, THERE ARE THE PREDICTIVE PROCESS MODELS, WHICH PROJECT THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE ON A SUBSET OF POINTS REDUCING THE COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE CHOICE OF THESE POINTS IS DISCUSSED IN THIS TEXT. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO PROPOSE A NON-GAUSSIAN PREDICTIVE PROCESS MODEL THAT ALLOWS REALIST MODELING OF SPATIAL VARIABLES WITH A LOW COMPUTATIONAL COST.

"THE INCREASE OF VIM OCCURRENCES ON SPAR AND MONOCOLUMN PLATFORMS WAS THE MOTIVATION TO STUDY THE VORTEX-INDUCED VIBRATIONS OF CYLINDERS WITH LOW ASPECT RATIO AND SMALL MASS RATIO UNDER A FUNDAMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. THE PRESENT WORK WAS ALSO MOTIVATED BY THE SMALL NUMBER OF WORKS IN THE LITERATURE DEALING WITH VIV OF CYLINDERS WITH LOW ASPECT RATIO, AS WELL AS BY THE SCARCE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FLOW MODELS AROUND THIS CYLINDERS, WHICH JUSTIFY THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIORS OBSERVED. AIMING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM, THREE GROUPS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH CYLINDERS OF 0.1 <= L/D <= 2.0 WERE CARRIED OUT IN A RECIRCULATING WATER CHANNEL AT ESCOLA POLIT�CNICA OF UNIVERSITY OF S�O PAULO, AS FOLLOW: FIRSTLY, THE FLOW AROUND STATIONARY CYLINDERS
DIFFERENT FLOTATION STRATEGIES (REAGENTS, PH AND ROUTE) HAVE BEEN ADOPTED TO SEPARATE APATITE FROM CARBONATES AROUND THE WORLD. LITERATURE PROVIDES EVIDENCES THAT CRYSTALLINITY AFFECTS FLOTATION RESPONSE OF APATITE AND CALCITE WITH SODIUM OLEATE. FURTHERMORE, DISSOLUTION OF SALT-TYPE MINERALS INFLUENCES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MINERAL SURFACE AND FLOTATION REAGENTS, BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT ADSORPTION MECHANISM IS THE SURFACE PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM OLEATE ONTO MINERAL/WATER INTERFACE. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRYSTALLINITY, DISSOLUTION KINETICS AND FLOTATION RESPONSE OF APATITES AND CALCITES FROM DIFFERENT GENESIS (IGNEOUS, METAMORPHIC AND SEDIMENTARY) AND ORIGINS. FOUR SORTS OF MINERALS WERE UTILIZED: MINERALS PURIFIED FROM ORES, MINERALS PREVIOUSLY PURIFIED, NATURALLY PURE MINERALS AND COLLECTION SAMPLES. THEY WERE CHARACTERIZED BY X-RAY FLUORESCENCE AND X-RAY MICROANALYSIS (WDS/EDS). PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AS SPECIFIC GRAVITY (D), SURFACE A
AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE IS A SITE OF INTENSE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND THAT PREDOMINATE THE DEPOSITION OF PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATERIAL AND ITS SUBSEQUENT MINERALIZATION. THE BENTHIC COMPARTMENT IS CONSIDERED A RELEVANT SOURCE OF ORGANIC CARBON FOR THE AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM.

BACKGROUND: LACTOFERRIN IN HUMAN BREAST MILK HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROTECT NEWBORNS FROM INFECTION BY BINDING TO IRON AND DEPRIVING IT FROM PATHOLOGIC BACTERIA THAT NEED IRON TO PROLIFERATE. IF IRON-ENRICHED FORTIFIER IS ADDED TO BREAST MILK, IT MIGHT IMPAIR THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF LACTOFERRIN AND INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION IN NEWBORNS. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE BACTERIAL GROWTH IN PURE COLOSTRUM VERSUS COLOSTRUM WITH HUMAN MILK FORTIFIER CONTAINING IRON. METHODS: THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN 78 SAMPLES OF PURE COLOSTRUM OR OF COLOSTRUM WITH ADDED HUMAN MILK FORTIFIER CONTAINING IRON WAS COMPARED. FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, FILTER PAPER DISCS WERE IMMERSED IN SAMPLES FROM EACH GROUP AND INCUBATED FOR 48 HOURS WITH 101COLONY FORMING UNITS/ML OF EACH STRAIN. FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT, 1 ML OF EACH STRAIN CONTAINING 107COLONY FORMING UNITS/ML WAS HOMOGENIZED WITH 1 ML OF EITHER COLOSTRUM OR COLOSTRUM WITH HUMAN MILK FORTIFIER, SEEDED INTO A PETRI DISH, AND INC

INTRODUCTION: THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CONSIDERS THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE (PHC) AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE. MUCH EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS OF APS ARE DESCRIBED, HOWEVER, THERE IS A GREAT HETEROGENEITY IN THE CARE PROVIDED, WHICH AFFECTS HEALTH OUTCOMES. THUS, STUDIES THAT EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY HOW CARE HAS BEEN OFFERED, IN WHICH POINTS ARE OCCURRING FAULTS AND WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES FOR ACTION, SEEKING TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF CARE PROVIDED. ACTUALLY, THE BRAZILIAN HEALTH SYSTEM AND THE PHC ORGANIZATION ARE BEING RESTRUCTURED. EVALUATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN OUR COUNTRY ARE SHOWING SOME POSITIVE IMPACTS, BUT THE RESULTS ARE STILL INCONSISTENT. ONE OF THESE RESULTS IS THE MAINTENANCE OF HIGH RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR PRIMARY CARE SENSITIVE CONDITIONS (ICSAP) AND THE INCREASE OF THESE CONDITIONS THE CITY OF S�O PAULO.

THE INTEREST IN STUDIES ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IS INCREASING IN ALL ASPECTS OF MODERN SOCIETY AS THEY CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. THE PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIFFERS AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND ITS CHARACTERIZATION IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT IN THE PEDIATRIC AGE RANGE AS EACH DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE PRESENTS SPECIFIC DEMANDS. CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM ARE VERY FREQUENT AND MAY REQUIRE IMMEDIATE INTERVENTIONS TO PRESERVE THE RENAL FUNCTION. ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY NEEDED PROCEDURES IS THE CONFECTION OF STOMAS. WE HAVE EVALUATED IN A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 28 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH URINARY MALFORMATIONS, AND THEIR CAREGIVERS, USING THE AUTOQUESTIONNAIRE QUALIT� DE VIE ENFANTI IMAG� AND SHORT-FORM 36 (SF-36), RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH 38 HEALTHY CONTROL AGE-PAIRED CHILDREN/CAREGIVERS.

THE GENUS STENOTROPHOMONAS COMPRISES TWELVE SPECIES OF GRAM- NEGATIVE AND NON-FERMENTATIVE BACTERIA, WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE SPECIES S. MALTOPHILIA IS THE ONLY ONE, UNTIL THE PRESENT, THAT INCLUDES OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENIC STRAINS IN HUMANS. S. MALTOPHILIA GAINED CLINICAL IMPORTANCE BY BEING INVOLVED IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISSED PATIENTS AND IN NICUS, WITH HIGH RATES OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLINICAL ISOLATES OF S. MALTOPHILIA SHARE AROUND 85% OF GENOMIC HOMOLOGY AND THIS DIFFERENCE MAY BE A CONSEQUENCE OF ADAPTATION TO THE DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL NICHES WHERE S. MALTOPHILIA CAN BE FOUND. ALTHOUGH INFECTION AND/OR COLONIZATION BY S.

"THE PERIOD EXTENDING FROM THE FOLLICULAR EMERGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE FORMATION OF A DOMINANT FOLLICLE REQUIRES A REMARKABLE TISSUE RESHAPING. THE ACTION OF ENZYMES THAT PROMOTE COLLAGEN LYSIS, SUCH AS MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMP), IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS PROCESS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THOSE ENZYMES IS TRIGGERED BY AN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF CIRCLING LH, WHICH ACTS ON THE OVARIAN SURFACE EPITHELIUM (OSE). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEEPEN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ACTION OF MRNA OF MMP-1 AND MMP-2 ALONG THE FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT IN MARES BY USING THE TECHNIQUE OF REAL-TIME POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (REAL-TIME PCR) TO RELATE THE LUTEINIZING HORMONE RECEPTOR (LHR) MRNA EXPRESSION AND THE IMMUNOLOCALIZATION OF LHR IN THE CELLS THAT COMPOSE OSE IN THE REGION OF THE OVULATION FOSSA.

"THE NICKEL LATERITIC ORE FROM NIQUEL�NDIA � GOI�S - IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WELL KNOWN NI LATERITIC DEPOSITS IN BRAZIL. HIGH NICKEL CONTENTS, THE DEPOSIT DIMENSION AND ALSO, THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH CLAY MINERALS ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR RESEARCHERS, SUCH AS TRESCASES AND SANTOS, TO HAVE STUDIED IT IN THE 1970S. THE CUBAN AND AUSTRALIAN DEPOSITS HAVE NICKEL ASSOCIATED TO OXIDIZED ORES AND SERPENTINE, RESPECTIVELY, BUT AT NIQUELANDIA, NICKEL IS SPECIALLY ASSOCIATED TO SMECTITES AND VERMICULITES. THE CARON PROCESS IS NOT THE MOST SUITABLE FOR TREATING NI-BEARING CLAY MINERALS, AS THOSE PRESENT IN NIQUEL�NDIA. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE MANY LOSSES RELATED TO SILICATED ORE.

IN THE MINING INDUSTRY CONTEXT, RECONCILIATION CAN BE DEFINED AS THE PRACTICE OF COMPARING THE TONNAGE AND AVERAGE GRADE OF ORE PREDICTED BY THE GEOLOGICAL MODELS WITH THE TONNAGE AND GRADE GENERATED BY THE PROCESSING OR METALLURGICAL PLANT. THIS PRACTICE HAS SHOWN AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANCE, SINCE, IF CORRECTLY EXECUTED, ALLOWS TO IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY ON SHORT-TERM PLANNING AND TO OPTIMIZE THE MINING AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE USEFULNESS OF RECONCILIATION RELIES ON THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE INPUT DATA, GENERATED BY DIFFERENT SAMPLING METHODS. SUCCESSFUL RECONCILIATION CAN BE ILLUSORY. IN MANY CASES, ERRORS GENERATED AT ONE POINT OF THE PROCESS ARE OFFSET BY ERRORS GENERATED AT OTHER POINTS, RESULTING IN EXCELLENT RECONCILIATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS FACT CAN HIDE COMPENSATING BIASES IN THE SYSTEM THAT MAY SURFACE SOMEDAY.

WATER IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FOCUSES OF GLOBAL DEBATE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, IF NOT THE FOREMOST. THE INFLUENCE OF WATER ON NATURAL SYSTEMS AND HUMAN LIFE IN GENERAL, AND THE CONTINUITY OF ITS USES ARE INCREASINGLY CONDITIONED, BY THE QUALIFICATIONS IN MANAGEMENT AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEASURES THAT GUARANTEE QUALITY AND QUANTITY FOR THE USE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. AMONG THE CONCERNS OF ANY PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL THAT PLAYS A ROLE IN WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, THE INTEGRITY OF NATURAL CONDITIONS IS ALWAYS DESIRED. MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE NATURAL CONDITIONS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION GEOMORPHOLOGICAL, CLIMATIC, BIOLOGICAL AND HUMAN ASPECTS.

INTRODUCTION: PUBERTY GATHERS THE PHYSICAL CHANGES OF ADOLESCENCE SUCH AS THE GROWTH SPURT AND EVOLUTION OF SEXUAL MATURATION. AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGIC MARK OF PUBERTY IN FEMALES IS MENARCHE. FOR ITS OCCURRENCE AN INTERACTION OF MULTIPLE FACTORS ARE REQUIRED, MAINLY THE NUTRITIONAL STATUS WHOSE BODY FAT, DEPENDING ON ITS AMOUNT, MIGHT TRIGGER NOT ONLY THE FIRST PERIOD, BUT ALSO THE MAINTENANCE OF REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLES. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INDICATORS OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS (WEIGHT, HEIGHT, ARM CIRCUMFERENCE AND BODY MASS INDEX) AND MATURITY (AGE AND SEXUAL MATURITY) FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF MENARCHE AND IT ASSESSED THE PERCEPTION OF BODY IMAGE COMPARED WITH THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THIS EVENT.

INTRODUCTION: PARKINSON'S DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA AND CELL LOSS IN LOCUS COERULEUS, CONCOMITANT LOSS OF DOPAMINE NEUROTRANSMITTER AND CONTINUING DEPOSITION OF PROTEIN WITHIN THE BRAIN AS INTRACELLULAR INCLUSIONS. THE DISEASE HAS A CAUDAL-ROSTRAL PROGRESSION, BEGINNING IN THE DORSAL NUCLEUS OF VAGUS NERVE AND, IN A LESS EXTENT, IN THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM, PROGRESSING TO THE MIDBRAIN AND FINALLY TO THE BASAL FOREBRAIN AND THE NEOCORTEX. ABOUT 90% OF THE CASES ARE IDIOPATHIC AND THE MAIN RISK FACTOR IS AGEING. IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENOME-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS AND OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THIS DISEASE, THE INVESTIGATION OF GLOBAL GENE EXPRESSION IN DIFFERENT TARGET TISSUES HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THIS FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC APPROACH IS BASED ON DNA MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY AND ON THE USE OF BIOINFORMATICS FOR ANALYZING THE DATA.

THE NEONATAL IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN CONSIDERED FUNCTIONALLY IMMATURE AND RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE NEONATE TO INFECTIONS MAY BE DUE TO FUNCTIONAL ALTERATIONS IN ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS THAT CAN PROMPT TO SECONDARY DEFICIENCIES IN ADAPTIVE RESPONSES. THE ACTIVATION OF ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS IS TRIGGERED BY STIMULATION OF RECEPTORS SUCH AS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRS) AND CHANGES IN THE ACTIVATION OF THESE RECEPTORS MAY LEAD TO A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THE ACTIVATION OF INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING PATHWAY PROTEINS AND CONSEQUENT CHANGES IN PRO- AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE LEVELS, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO AN INEFFICIENT IMMUNE RESPONSE OF THE NEONATE.

FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF PELOTAS, PELOTAS, STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL THE GROWTH OF PEACH TREES (PRUNUS L.) PLAYS A MAJOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ROLE IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL. IN THE YEAR 2012 ALONE, 132,874 TONS OF PEACHES WERE PRODUCED IN THE STATE. THIS ACTIVITY IS LARGELY PERFORMED ON FAMILY RUN FARMS AND INVOLVES A HIGH NUMBER OF FARM WORKERS, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO KEEPING FAMILIES IN RURAL AREAS. BASIC MACHINERY AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CROP IMPLEMENTATION. THE PEACH TREE IS A PLANT THAT DEMANDS FERTILIZATION THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE CYCLE, AND NUTRIENT ABSORPTION IS MAINLY CARRIED OUT BY ITS ROOTS. SINCE THE ADSORPTION AREA IS SMALLER THAN THE DEPOSITION AREA PERFORMED BY CONVENTIONAL EQUIPMENT, THERE MAY BE UNNECESSARY WASTE IN THE FERTILIZATION OF ORCHARDS, RAISING COSTS. THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE TODA

FROM THE FIRST MOMENT IN HISTORY, WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED UNTIL TODAY, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO CURE FOR DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), BUT CONTROL OF ITS DELETERIOUS EFFECTS. THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT THIS DISEASE HAS BEEN VERY BROAD, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHEN VARIOUS TYPES OF DIABETES, AMONG THEM TYPE 1 TYPE 2, WERE DIFFERENTIATED. THIS TRAIT OF FATALISM ABOUT THE HEALING OF DM HAS BOOSTED THE MANY RESEARCHES TO BE CARRIED OUT, FOCUSING IN RECENT YEARS ON FACTORS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY UNSUSPECTED, INCLUDING HIGHLIGHTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL, SINCE SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE INDICATED A POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DM1 AND VITAMIN D, BECAUSE OF ITS ROLE IN THE ACTIVATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN SEVERAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FUNCTION OF UV RADIATION IN THE METABOLIC PROCESS OF THIS VITAMIN BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL MUST RECEIVE DIRECT SUNLIGHT ON THE SKIN FOR ITS SYNTHESIS TO OCCUR.

N THIS SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION, THE ASPECTS OF THE MOLYBDENUM AND MOLYBDENITE CHAIN IN THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WERE DISCUSSED, SHOWING THE OCCURRENCES AND THEIR MAIN APPLICATIONS. CURRENTLY, IN BRAZIL THE ONLY OPTION FOR THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THIS MINERAL RESOURCE IS THE MOLYBDENITE AS A CO-PRODUCT OR BY-PRODUCT OF EMERALDS SMALL-SCALE MINING, AT THE REGION OF CAMPO FORMOSO AND PINDOBA�U, BA. THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ORES, PRODUCTS AND THE PROCESS USED IN THE RECOVERY OF MOLYBDENITE FROM CAMPO FORMOSO HAS SHOWN THAT BARRIERS OF TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE PRODUCED CONCENTRATE, GENERATE PRODUCTS OF LOW MOLYBDENITE GRADE AND, THEREFORE, OF LOW ECONOMIC VALUE. THIS IS DUE TO THE PRESENCE, IN PARTICULAR, OF OTHER HYDROPHOBIC MINERALS, SUCH AS TALC, WITH PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF MOLYBDENITE AND ARE CO-FLOATED IN THE BENEFICIATION PROCESS. ONCE DETECTED THE PROBLEM, AND AFTER AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE SURVEY ON THE SUBJECT, A

QUILOMBOS BRAZILIANS AND THE REMAINING AREAS ARE THE RESULT OF A HISTORICAL PROCESS OF THE FORMATION OF THE BRAZILIAN NATION, WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE PORTUGUESE COLONIZATION. THE FORMATION OF THE QUILOMBO OCCURRED AS A FORM OF RESISTANCE TO THE REGIME OF SLAVERY DURING THE COLONIAL BRAZIL AND EVEN IN THE EMPIRE, AND TO THE PRESENT DAY ARE OCCUPIED BY PEOPLE WITHOUT FULL RECOGNITION OF SOCIETY. THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THIS ETHNIC GROUP HAVE NOT BEEN THE MOST FAVORABLE, AND IT IS KNOWN THAT SOCIAL AND MATERIAL CONDITIONS INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE HEALTH / DISEASE PROCESS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THESE MINORITIES. THE PROCESS OF HEALTH / ILLNESS IS THE RESULT OF A HISTORICAL PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRIORITIZE THE SEARCH FOR EQUITY THROUGH ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND UTILIZATION OF SERVICES THAT PROMOTE IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF CARE OF THESE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.

IT IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE OF HEAVY METALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RAISING THE LEVEL OF THEIR CONCENTRATIONS IN MANY AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. SOME METALS CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY TOXIC TO MANY LIFE FORMS, WHILE OTHERS ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL IN PRINCIPLE, BUT CAN BE TOXIC AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS. THE MOST COMMON MEANS OF INFECTION IS THE DISCHARGE OF EFFLUENTS NOT TREATED IN RIVERS, LAKES OR ESTUARIES. THE DETERMINATION OF METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN THE WATER MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR RATINGS IN THE SEDIMENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF ITS FORM IN THE ENVIRONMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION BY MEANS OF CHEMICAL SPECIATION. ONE OF THE METHODS USED TO FIND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE METALS IN DIFFERENT FORMS THAT MAKE UP THE SEDIMENT IS THE SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION, WHICH COMPRISES SUBJECTING THE PELLET SAMPLE TO CONDITIONS OF EXTRACTION STEPS INCREASINGLY STRONGER.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE STUDY OF THE ELECTRICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES, WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRICAL CURRENT AND VOLTAGE OF EACH PHASE CONDUCTOR, ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE LINE. USUALLY SUCH STUDIES ARE NOT PERFORMED, AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE POWER SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES ARE JUST ANOTHER ELEMENT, REPRESENTED BY A CIRCUIT, SAID EQUIVALENT, USUALLY CONFIGURED ON PI. THIS CIRCUIT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO THE POWER FLOW CALCULATIONS ON ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS, BUT IT HAS SERIOUS LIMITATIONS WITH REGARD TO LINE PERFORMANCE, WHICH JUSTIFY THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD IS USEFUL TO SIMULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE TRANSMISSION LINE. WITH THIS OBJECTIVE, THE STUDY WILL BE BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF TECHNIQUES TO SOLVE EQUATIONS OF THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE LINE.

IN THIS WORK WE HAVE STUDIED HOW TO INTRODUCE NONCOMMUTATIVITY TO SOME PHYSICAL SYSTEMS THROUGH THE SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES TO INVESTIGATE THE PROPERTIES OF THE NONCOMMUTATIVE (NC) SPACES. INITIALLY, WE DISCUSSED IN DETAILS ONE SYSTEMATIC WAY TO INTRODUCE NONCOMMUTATIVITY, BASED ON FADDEEV-JACKIW FORMALISM, CALLED SYMPLECTIC FORMALISM FOR INDUCTION OF NONCOMMUTATIVITY (SFINC). THIS FORMALISM WAS USED TO OBTAIN NC VERSIONS OF THE SU(2) SKYRME MODEL AND O(3) NONLINEAR SIGMA MODEL. AFTER THAT, THE ROTATIONAL INVARIANT NONCOMMUTATIVE NEWTON�S SECOND LAW WAS WRITTEN IN THE NC EXTENDED CLASSICAL PHASE SPACE. AMONG THE MAIN EFFECTS OF NONCOMMUTATIVITY IN THE DYNAMICS OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR TREATED IN THIS SPACE, WE NOTE THAT THE NONCOMMUTATIVITY INDUCES A STABLE PERTURBATION IN THE USUAL HARMONIC OSCILLATOR AND THE OSCILLATOR MAY EVEN NOT BE PERIODIC DEPENDING ON THE RATIO BETWEEN THE OSCILLATION FREQUENCY OF THE POSITION COORDINATE AND THE OSCILLATION FREQUENCY OF THE NC COORDINATE.

POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS ARE PHOTOSENSITIVE MATERIALS WIDELY USED IN LITHOGRAPHIC PROCESSES IN MICROELECTRONICS AND OPTIC FOR COMPONENT RELIEF MANUFACTURING. THE PHOTORESISTS ARE USED AS MASKS FOR TRANSFERRING OF GEOMETRIC PATTERNS TO PRODUCE MORE THAN 95% OF THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS EMPLOYED IN MICROELECTRONICS. IN OPTICS, THE PHOTORESISTS ARE USED IN THE FABRICATION OF PERIODIC STRUCTURES WITH DIRACTIVE OPTICAL PROPERTIES. AN IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE OF THE CHARACTERIZATION OF SUCH PHOTORESISTS IS THE MASS SPECTROMETRY. THIS SPECTROSMETRY TOOL IS VERY POWERFUL IN THE STUDY OF SURFACES, CONTROL PROCESSES OF LM GROWTH IN MICROELECTRONICS AND OTHER BRANCHING OF SCIENCE.

THE NOTION OF STRING-LOCALIZED QUANTUM FIELDS WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED BY STEINMANN[2], BASED ON THE IDEAS OF MANDELSTAM[3] AND REFINED BY MUND, SCHROER AND YNGVASON[5]. THE MOTIVATION OF DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF AN INFRAPARTICLE REPRESENTATION FOR PHOTONS IS, THROUGH THIS REPRESENTATION, FUTURELY CONSTRUCTING A FIELD THAT�S A SUBSTITUTE OF THE DIRAC FIELD AND DESCRIBES THE ELECTRON AS AN INFRAPARTICLE. THE NECESSITY OF DESCRIBING THE ELECTRON AS AN INFRAPARTICLE IS SHOWN IN [14]. IN CHAPTER 5 WE DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE OF INFRAPARTICLE REPRESENTATIONS IN D=2 IN A WAY WE HAVE NOT FOUND IN THE LITERATURE AND WE CONJECTURE THE EXISTENCE IN D=4 OF AN INFRAPARTICLE REPRESENTATION FOR PHOTONS BY FIELDS WITH STRING LOCALIZATION AND EXPLAIN WHY USING THE EXISTENCE IN D=2 AS AN ANALOGY.

THE MODALITY OF DEVELOPMENT DISTRIBUTED OF SOFTWARE GROWS EVERY DAY. ONE OF THE REASONS TO THIS GROWTH IS THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT AFFECTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE, TURNING THE CO-LOCALIZED DEVELOPMENT MORE DIFFICULT AND LESS COMPETITIVE. THE ENTERPRISES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE ARE LOOKING FOR QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS, REDUCTION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS, HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. HOWEVER, BESIDE THE PROBLEMS INHERENT TO THE PROCESSES OF CONVENTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, A DISTRIBUTED TEAM FACES OTHER CHALLENGES, SUCH AS THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND TEMPORAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TEAM MEMBERS, DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE AND LANGUAGE, IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO COMMUNICATION.

THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL THEORIES THAT SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN AND CLASSIFY THE HUMAN PERSONALITY AND THE CONCEPT OF TEMPERAMENT IS CENTRAL FOR MANY OF THEM. FOR MOST AUTHORS, TEMPERAMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY PERSONALITY TRAITS WITH BIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC DETERMINATION, FOR BEING PRESENT SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD AND REMAINING RELATIVELY STABLE THROUGHOUT LIFE. AT LATE 80S, THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIST CLAUDE ROBERT CLONINGER FORMULATED A PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL THEORY IN WHICH PERSONALITY WAS REGARDED AS SYNONYMOUS OF TEMPERAMENT AND CONSISTED OF TRAITS OR DIMENSIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, THIS AUTHOR EXTENDS HIS THEORY TO INCLUDE MORE SUBJECTIVE ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATIONALIZATION OF EXPERIENCE AND THE SELF-CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WERE CALLED DIMENSIONS OF CHARACTER.

OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTRUSIVE AND DISTRESSING IMAGES, THOUGHTS OR URGES (OBSESSIONS) AND/OR REPETITIVE MENTAL OR MOTOR ACTS AIMED AT REDUCING THE ANXIETY OR PERFORMED ACCORDING TO CERTAIN RULES (COMPULSIONS). IT IS A CHRONIC AND FREQUENT CONDITION WITH A 1-MONTH PREVALENCE RANGING FROM 0.3 TO UP TO 3.1%. IT IS NOT CLEAR IF LATE-ONSET OCD IS ASSOCIATED WITH DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS. REMARKABLY, SEVERAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE ON THIS THEME REMAIN. IN CONTRAST, THE EXISTENCE OF A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS WITH EARLY-ONSET OCD HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL STUDIES. THIS MADE US WONDER IF THE SAME WOULDN�T HAPPEN TO PATIENTS WITH THE ONSET IN LATER STAGES OF LIFE.

THIS WORK CONCERNS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED ELECTRONIC SYSTEM DEDICATED TO CALIBRATE VELOCIMETRIC WATER METERS. SUCH SYSTEM WORKS COUPLED TO TEST AND PRE-CALIBRATION BENCHES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE CALIBRATION TIME AND TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR DUE TO FATIGUE, AND, BY THESE MEANS, INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY FOR THIS COMPLEX OPERATION, BOTH IN MANUFACTURER�S PLANTS OR CITIES� WORKSHOPS OF SANITATION. ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE WHICH SENSES THE WATER METER TOTALIZER, SENDING SIGNALS TO A MICROCONTROLLER, WHICH COMPARES THIS READING TO A STANDARD ALREADY EXISTING IN THE BENCH, AND, THROUGH THIS COMPARISON, DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF ERROR TO BE CORRECTED, THEN, AT THE END OF THE PROCESS, SENDING SIGNALS TO A STEPPER MOTOR WHICH ACTS DIRECTLY ON THE REGULATOR DEVICE OF THE METER. AT THE CONTROL DEVELOPMENT PHASE, OR, WHEN CALCULATING THE ACTION OVER THE WATER METER REGULATOR, A STUDY WAS PROPOSED COMPARING A CURVE ADJUST AND AN ALGORITHM OF FUZZY LOGIC. BO
THE RELATION BETWEEN MAJOR DEPRESSION (MD) AND ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD) MAY HAVE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS: MD MAY BE A RISK FACTOR FOR DEMENTIA OR COMORBID STATE WITH DEMENTIA, OR EVEN A NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYNDROME IN AD. BOTH DISEASES OCCUR WITH SIMILAR SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE CHANGES, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BOTH DISORDERS. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE COGNITIVE PREVAILING IN EACH PATHOLOGY AND SEVERITY OF THESE DEFICITS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN MD, AD, DEPRESSION IN AD, AND IN HEALTHY ELDERLY. A TOTAL OF 212 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED AD (N=46), MD (N=61), DEPRESSION IN AD (N=43) AND HEALTHY ELDERLY (N=62). THE PATIENTS WERE SUBMITTED TO A BATTERY OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS, INCLUDING: MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION, REY AUDITORY VERBAL LEARNING TEST, REY COMPLEX FIGURE, DIGIT SPAN, DIGIT SYMBOL, SIMILARITIES, TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B, VERBAL FLUENCY TEST (ANIMAL) AND STROOP TEST.

IN THIS DISSERTATION, WE STUDY THE M-VECTOR SPIN GLASS MODEL WITH IN NITE-RANGE INTERACTIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF RANDOM MAGNETIC ELDS. THIS STUDY FALLS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF DISORDERED MAGNETIC SYSTEMS, A TOPIC THAT REMAINS OF INTEREST IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS. THE SIMPLEST VERSION OF THIS MODEL (M = 1) AND MOST STUDIED IS KNOWN AS SHERRINGTON-KIRKPATRICK MODEL (SK), WHICH PRESENTS A RICH PANORAMA OF SURPRISING RESULTS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXISTENCE OF A PHASE TRANSITION LINE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC ELD, CALLED DE ALMEIDA-THOULESS LINE AND A LOW TEMPERATURE PHASE DESCRIBED BY A CONTINUOUS ORDER PARAMETER.

IN THIS WORK WE STUDY THE DECOHERENCE MECHANISMS BETWEEN THE LEVELS IN AN ATOMIC SYSTEM. THAT WAS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF A PROBE BEAM, WHICH PASSED THROUGH AN ATOMIC THREE LEVEL SYSTEM IN �LAMBDA�, CONFIGURATION, IN THE PRESENCE OF AN INTENSE CONTROL BEAM. THE ATOMIC SYSTEM WAS PREPARED IN A COHERENT SUPERPOSITION OF ITS GROUND STATES, THE �DARK-STATE�, THROUGH OPTICAL PUMPING PROCESSES, WHICH ENABLED THE OBSERVATION OF AN EFFECT KNOWN ON LITERATURE AS ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY (EIT). THE EIT EFFECT IS VERIFIED WHEN BOTH FIELDS ARE RESONANT BY TWO PHOTONS, A RAMAN RESONANCE, AND LEADS TO A CANCELLATION OF THE BEAM'S ABSORPTION BY THE ATOMS. FOR THE EXPERIMENTS, WE USED A CELL WHICH CONTAINED CESIUM ATOMIC VAPOR AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND SENSED THE HYPERFINE TRANSITION F=3 - F'=2 FROM THE D2 LINE. THE REAL PHYSICAL SYSTEM CONTAINS DEGENERACIES, BUT CAN BEHAVE AS A SIMPLE THREE LEVEL SYSTEM WHEN THE INCIDENT BEAM POLARIZATIONS ARE ADEQUATELY MANIPULATED,

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS JOB IS TO ANALYZE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION BETWEEN WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN THE BRAZILIAN BUILDINGS TO DEFINE WHAT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT BETWEEN THEM. TO DO THE ANALYSIS, A GROUP WITH 9 BUILDINGS WAS DEFINED. THESE BUILDINGS HAVE 8, 12 OR 16 FLOORS WITH 4, 8 OR 12 APARTMENTS EACH ONE. THE HYDRAULIC INSTALLATION OF EACH BUILDING WAS DIMENSIONED ACCORDING THE BRAZILIAN STANDARD NBR5626:1998 AND IT WAS SIMULATED TROUGH MATLAB/SIMULINK SOFTWARE, CONSIDERING THE DAILY OPERATION CHARACTERISTICS. WITH THE SIMULATION RESULTS AND CONSIDERING THE CHARACTERISTIC OF OPERATION, THE NEEDED ENERGY CONSUMPTION CAN BE DEFINED. THEN, THE SYSTEM ENDOWED OF ONLY LOWER RESERVOIR WITH PIPE LINE DIVIDED IN PRESSURE ZONES PRESENTED AS THE MOST EFFICIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND AMOUNT OF PUMPED WATER. THE OTHER SYSTEMS ANALYZED PRESENTED NEAR RESULTS BETWEEN THEM BUT WITH EFFICIENCY LOWER THAN THE FIRST SYSTEM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WITH THE DIVISION OF PIPE LINE IN SEGM

FIELD ACTIVITIES WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE PHASES, OBTAINING DATA FROM AUTOMATIC WEATHER STATIONS INSTALLED IN MUNICIPALITIES OF MOSSOR�-RN, SERRA TALHADA-PE, PETROLINA-PE AND JUAZEIRO-BA DURING THE WET PERIOD (05/12/2007 TO 05/26/2007) AND DRY PERIOD (11/15/2008 TO 12/05/2008). IN THE SECOND PHASE, DATA WERE COLLECTED IN PETROLINA-PE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 2012. THE THIRD PHASE EVALUATED THE INFLUENCE OF TREE PLANTING IN THE URBAN MICROCLIMATE IN JUAZEIRO-BA DURING THE DRY PERIOD (10/24/2012 TO 11/09/2012). HEAT ISLANDS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENCES IN AIR TEMPERATURE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE CITIES SURVEYED, WHILE THERMAL DISCOMFORT WAS DETERMINED BY ADAPTING THE CALCULATION PROPOSED BY THOM OF THE THERMAL DISCOMFORT INDEX (TDI), OBTAINING ADJUSTED EQUATIONS FOR MAXIMUM (TDIX) AND MINIMUM (TDIM) VALU
IN TROPICAL REGIONS, SUCH AS THE BRAZILIAN SEMIARID REGION, THE REDUCTION OF FOREST AREAS BY EXTRACTING FIREWOOD, SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK, ASSOCIATED WITH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF THE CLIMATIC AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF EXTENSIVE AREAS. RESEARCH IN EXPERIMENTAL BASINS HAVE SHOWN THE ROLE OF VEGETATION ON EROSION REDUCTION AS A MAJOR FACTOR FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SMALL RURAL BASINS, BUT GENERALLY DO NOT CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS THESIS HAS AS ITS MAIN RESEARCH PROBLEM THE CONSERVATION AND/OR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OF SMALL RURAL WATERSHEDS IN THE SEMIARID REGION OF BRAZIL. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GUIDES THE WORK IS THAT A METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS FUTURE SCENARIOS OF LAND USE AND OCCUPATION AND THE COMMUNITIES� RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT WILL RESULT IN A GREATER POSSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSERVATION STRATEGIES.

THE REGIONAL SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A FARMING TECHNIFIED EFFICIENT FOR THE INCREASE AND STABILITY OF FOOD PRODUCTION, GENERATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IRRIGATED PERIMETERS BECOMES IMPORTANT TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, REDUCE THE SEASONALITY OF FOOD SUPPLY WHERE LACK OF RAINFALL IS A LIMITING FACTOR. TO BOOST IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN THE SEMIARID PARAIBA, ESPECIALLY FRUIT TREES, WAS DESIGNED THE IRRIGATION PROJECT OF WETLANDS OF SOUSA (IPWS), REPLACING GRADUALLY AREAS OF CAATINGA BY DIFFERENT FARMING SYSTEMS. THIS CHANGE IN LAND USE CAUSES AN IMBALANCE IN THE ECOSYSTEM, WHICH ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF VERTISOLS UNWIELDY, REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ATTRIBUTES AS INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES THAT ENSURE HIGH PRODUCTIVITY WITHOUT COMPROMISING ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL OF THE ENTERPRISE.

OWING TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF NANOFABRICATION TECHNIQUES, A GREAT DEAL OF WORKS ON NANOSTRUCTURED SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILMS APPEARED SINCE THE LATE 1990S. MANY OF THEM AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE VORTEX DYNAMICS IN THIS SYSTEM AND ITS FEATURES. THESE SYSTEMS USUALLY COMPRISE A REGULAR ARRAY OF HOLES OR MAGNETIC INCLUSIONS, WHICH ACT AS VORTEX TRAPS, PROVIDING A PERIODIC PINNING POTENTIAL FOR VORTICES. IN CONTRAST, A PLAIN FILM IS CHARACTERIZED BY RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED INHOMOGENEITIES. FOR THAT REASON, VORTICES IN NANOSTRUCTURED SUPERCONDUCTOR PRESENT MANY INTERESTING PHENOMENA THAT CANNOT BE FOUND IN PLAIN FILMS. POSSIBLY THE MOST REMARKABLE IS THE MATCHING EFFECT DUE TO THE COMMENSURABILITY BETWEEN THE VORTEX LATTICE AND THE ARTIFICIAL PINNING LATTICE. DEPENDING ON THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED TO THE SYSTEM (TEMPERATURE, APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELD, APPLIED TRANSPORT CURRENT AND THE PARAMETERS OF THE PINNING LATTICE) THE VORTICES ORGANIZE THEMSELVES IN DISTINCT MANNERS AND THIS WILL, OBVIOUSLY, LEAD TO SEVERAL MACROSCOPIC
IN THIS THESIS WE STUDIED THE GENERATION OF PURE SPIN CURRENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE MAGNETIZATION OF CONDUCTORS AND ISOLATORS FERROMAGNETIC FILMS. THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE STUDIED WERE MAGNETIC TRILAYERS AND BILAYERS COMPOSED OF FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS (METALS AND INSULATORS) AND NON-MAGNETIC METALS. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THE MAGNETIC RELAXATION IN THESE SYSTEMS DUE TO THE INTERACTION WITH THE NONMAGNETIC ADJACENT MEDIA. THE GENERATION OF PURE SPIN CURRENTS OCCURRED THROUGH THE SPIN PUMPING AND SPIN SEEBECK EFFECTS. IN THE FIRST EFFECT, THE MAGNETIZATION OF A FERROMAGNETIC FILM (FM), PRECESSING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A RF FIELD, INJECTS SPIN ANGULAR MOMENTUM IN THE NON-MAGNETIC (NM) ADJACENT MEDIUM. THIS EFFECT WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A SPIN CURRENT THROUGH THE INTERFACE FM/NM IS ALSO INTERPRETED AS AN ACCUMULATION OF SPINS IN THE NON-MAGNETIC MEDIUM AND WORKS LIKE AN ADDITIONAL CHANNEL RELAXATION FOR THE MAGNETIZATION. IN THE SECOND EFFECT, WE INVESTIGATED THE GENERATION OF SPI

"ABSTRACT THE FIELD EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN THE COMMUNITY ""SALT CREEK,"" S�O PAULO DO POTENGI- RN, TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OF ELEPHANT GRASS AND SORGHUM CROPS IRRIGATED WITH UNDERGROUND WATER AND REJECT THE DESALINATION OF BRACKISH WATER. TWO EXPERIMENTAL AREAS WERE USED: FIRST (TREATMENT 1) WITH 0.13 HA, IRRIGATED WITH UNDERGROUND WATER AND SECOND (TREATMENT 2) WITH 0.29 HA, IRRIGATED WITH WASTE WATER FROM DESALINATION OF WELL WATER. EACH AREA SURVEYED WAS DIVIDED EQUALLY FOR BOTH CROPS: SORGHUM AND NAPIER GRASS(HALF AND HALF WITH GREEN GRASS WITH GRASS PURPLE). TO EVALUATE THE RESPONSE OF THE TWO CROPS TO SALINITY, THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS WERE ANALYZED: PLANT HEIGHT, FRESH AND DRY WEIGHT, PROTEIN CONTENT, SOIL SALINITY, ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND POWER OF EXTRACTING SALT FROM THE SOIL. THE INCREASING SALINITY OF IRRIGATION WATER FROM 2.89 DS M-1 (TREATMENT 1) TO 3.69 DS M-1 (TREATMENT 2) REDUCED PLANT HEIGHT, THE CRUDE PROTEIN CONTENT AND YIELD OF FRESH AND DRY MASS OF BOTH CULTURES.

POLYMERS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM WORLDWIDE , BECAUSE IT ACCUMULATE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND BECOME A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION. AMONG THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS SUGGESTED, THE BIODEGRADATION COMBINED WITH SURFACE TREATMENT BY UV RADIATION IS ASSUMED TO BE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY. THIS TREATMENT CONSISTS IN THE INSERTION OF FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ON THE POLYMER SURFACE. IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE THAT MAINTAINS THE PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE MATERIALS AND AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASES THE HYDROPHILICITY, WHICH WOULD FACILITATIE THE BIODEGRADATION PROCESS . THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE INFLUENCE OF THE TREATMENTS FOR THREE DIFFERENT POLYMERS . THE FILMS WERE IRRADIATED WITH UV IN THE PRESENCE OF O2 ATMOSPHERE ALTERNATING TREATMENT TIMES . THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS (UNTREATED AND TREATED) BY THE ACTION OF TWO STRAINS OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGUS METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE (E6 AND CG9).

IT'S NOTORIOUS THE GROWING CONCERN BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES WITH THE SYSTEM INSULATING DISTRIBUTION NETWORK PERFORMANCE, NAMELY, INSULATORS, SWITCHES, BUSHINGS AND SURGE ARRESTS. ALL EQUIPMENT OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE INSULATING DEVICES DEPENDS THE CONTINUITY AND QUALITY OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. SEEING THAT THE NETWORK OPERATES FOR DECADES AND SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM MAY BE AT THE LIMIT OF USEFUL LIFE, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY SUCH COMPONENT FAULT BEFORE IT HAPPENS. THE USE OF PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFYING THESE COMPONENTS IS SHOWING TO BE A GOOD TECHNIQUE TO INDICATE THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR INTERVENTION MAINTENANCE. INSULATING SYSTEMS, WHEN SOME KINDS OF IMMINENT FAULT, THE ELECTRIC DEVICES TEND TO EMIT ULTRASONIC NOISE FROM PARTIAL INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL DISCHARGES. THE MAIN CAUSES OF DEFECTS IN INSULATING DEVICES ARE THE ABSENCE OF HANDLING CARE DURING INSTALLATION, PRECARIOUS FORMS OF STORAGE, AND AGING AS A FUNCTION OF TIME IN SERVICE.

THE ENVENOMATION BY VENOMOUS ANIMALS IS CONSIDERED A COMMON AND SERIOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS OF TROPICAL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ITS PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY MEDICAL AUTHORITIES WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH ANTIVENOMS ARE PRODUCED BY VARIOUS LABORATORIES IN EVERY CONTINENT, THE BURDEN OF ENVENOMATION CASES, CAUSING BOTH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, STILL HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE POPULATION AND ON HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY IN REGIONS OF SOUTHERN BRAZIL, ACCIDENTS WITH THE VENOMOUS CATERPILLAR LONOMIA OBLIQUA HAVE BEEN AN EMERGENT PROBLEM, NOT ONLY FOR THEIR HIGH INCIDENCE RATES, BUT ALSO BY THE SEVERITY OF THE CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES OBSERVED IN ENVENOMATION CASES. FREQUENTLY, ENVENOMED VICTIMS PRESENT A SEVERE HEMORRHAGIC SYNDROME THAT CAN PROGRESS TO ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI), INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE AND DEATH.

CANCER IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND THE SECOND CAUSE OF DEATH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WORK FROM A NUMBER OF LABORATORIES STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT TUMORS ARE ORGANIZED AS A HIERARCHY BASED ON A SUBSET OF CANCER CELLS THAT HAVE STEM-CELL PROPERTIES. THESE CELLS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY, DEPENDENT ON CONTEXTUAL SIGNALS WITHIN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND, TO BE RESPONSIVE TO DIFFERENTIATION THERAPY. HERE WE SHOW THAT SODIUM BUTYRATE (NAB), A HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR, DECREASES CELL PROLIFERATION AND COLONY FORMATION IN HUMAN MEDULLOBLASTOMA CELL LINES. THESE EFFECTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASED MRNA EXPRESSION OF GRIA2, A NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION MARKER, IN TWO OUT OF THREE CELL LINES TESTED. IN ADDITION, NEUROSPHERE FORMATION WAS IMPAIRED BY NAB EXPOSURE IN A CELL LINE SUBMITTED TO STEM CELLS PROPER MEDIA.

AS TESTS WERE PERFORMED WITH PHYSICAL DEVICES INDUSTRIAL (COMMERCIAL REAL VALVE) CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER VIA DATA ACQUISITION ANALOG BOARD, WHICH COMMUNICATES VIA STANDARD OPC INTERFACE TO OTHER OBJECTS OF CONTROL, FORMING A HYBRID ENVIRONMENT KNOWN AS HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP. FOR THE CHOICE OF PROCESS MODEL AND ITS CORRESPONDING CONTROL ACTION, IT WAS CONSIDERED A PLANT WITH SLOW DYNAMIC PROCESS WITH LOW DOMINANT TIME CONSTANT IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE VISUALIZATION OF PHENOMENA OF STICTION AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPENSATORS.

FOR A LONG TIME QUANTUM THEORY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN A PRAGMATIC WAY, CERTAINLY DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL ASPECTS THAT, DUE TO THEIR DIRECT APPLICATION, DEMANDED MOST PART OF THE EFFORTS. BEYOND THAT, TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS POSED MANY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF THE THEORY IN A FIELD MORE PHILOSOPHICAL THAN PHYSICAL. IN THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICS, WE ARE ABLE TO DIRECT THE DESERVED ATTENTION TO MORE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THIS THEORY. IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE AN EXPERIMENT THAT WOULD BE CAPABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE TIME SCALE OF THE COLLAPSE OF A WAVEFUNCTION. USING A PAIR OF ENTANGLED PHOTONS AND PERFORMING ONLY A PAIR OF MEASUREMENTS, ONE FOR EACH PHOTON, IT IS POSSIBLE, THROUGH SEVERAL REPETITIONS OF THIS PROCESS, TO DISTINGUISH THE SCENARIO WHERE THE WAVEFUNCTION PRESENTS AN INSTANTANEOUS COLLAPSE FROM ANOTHER WHERE IT TAKES A FINITE TIME TO OCCUR.
FOR SURVIVAL IN THE GLOBALIZED WORLD, COMPANIES OF VEHICLES NEED TO CONSTANTLY IMPROVE THEIR COMPETITIVENESS, BOTH IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT AND TO MEET REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF SAFETY, COST AND QUALITY. WITH REGARD TO BRAKING SYSTEMS, IS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THERE ARE STILL CERTAIN WEAKNESSES IN THE BRAKES OF MOTORIZED TODAY'S VEHICLES. THESE WEAKNESSES ARE EXPOSED BY THE SIMPLE OBSERVANCE OF NUMEROUS ESCAPE AREAS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ALSO BY NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY INEFFICIENCY IN THE VEHICLES BRAKE SYSTEMS. THUS, THIS WORK PRESENTS THE PROPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE FOR DISC BRAKE SYSTEM TESTS, INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND ELIMINATION OF WATER FILM ON THE DISCS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY OF THE BRAKES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, TO GREATER SAFETY IN DRIVING MOTOR VEHICLES. THE PROPOSED BRAKING SYSTEM MUST BE EASILY INTEGRABLE INTO ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION NETWORK OF CURRENT VEHICLES.

AVIAN PATHOGENIC E. COLI (APEC) IS THE CAUSATIVE AGENT OF COLIBACILLOSIS, A DISEASE THAT AFFECTS POULTRY AND OTHER BIRDS, MAINLY BETWEEN TWO AND TWELVE WEEKS OF AGE. THERE ARE MANY STUDIES ABOUT VIRULENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES IN APEC, BUT THEY DO NOT FULLY EXPLAIN ALL THE APEC PHENOTYPES. THEREFORE, OTHER VIRULENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES � NOT YET DESCRIBED � MUST BE PRESENT IN APEC STRAINS. IN ORDER TO FIND OUT NEW VIRULENCE GENES, WE MADE 1,800 RANDOM-TRANSPOSONS MUTANTS OF AN APEC INVASIVE STRAIN USING THE SIGNATURE-TAGGED MUTAGENESIS METHOD. THE MUTANTS WERE SELECTED USING AN IN VITRO INVASION ASSAY TO FIBROBLAST CELLS. THE SEQUENCE OF THE INSERTED TRANSPOSONS ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY MUTANTS THAT HAVE LOST THE CAPACITY OF INVADE THE CELLS. UNTIL NOW, WE TESTED ELEVEN OUT OF TWENTY POOLS OF NINETY MUTANTS EACH, AND FORTY-EIGHT MUTANTS APPEARED TO HAVE LOST THE INVASIVE CAPACITY. THE OTHER NINE POOLS WILL BE ANALYZED, AND ALL THE POSSIBLE NON-INVASIVE MUTANTS WILL BE TESTED AGAIN TO CONFIRM THE PHENOTYPE. THEN, THEY WI

"THE PETROV CLASSIFICATION IS AN IMPORTANT ALGEBRAIC CLASSIFICATION FOR THE WEYL TENSOR VALID IN 4-DIMENSIONAL SPACE-TIMES. IN THIS THESIS SUCH CLASSIFICATION IS GENERALIZED TO MANIFOLDS OF ARBITRARY DIMENSION AND SIGNATURE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY INTERPRETING THE WEYL TENSOR AS A LINEAR OPERATOR ON THE BUNDLE OF P-FORMS, FOR ANY P, AND COMPUTING THE JORDAN CANONICAL FORM OF THIS OPERATOR. THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE SPACES ARE ASSUMED TO BE COMPLEXIFIED, SO THAT DIFFERENT SIGNATURES CORRESPOND TO DIFFERENT REALITY CONDITIONS, PROVIDING A UNIFIED TREATMENT. A HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL GENERALIZATION OF THE SO-CALLED SELF-DUAL MANIFOLDS IS ALSO INVESTIGATED. THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULT RELATED TO THE PETROV CLASSIFICATION IS THE GOLDBERG-SACHS THEOREM.

VORTICES IN SUPERCONDUCTORS HAVE BEEN INTENSIVELY STUDIED SINCE ABRIKOSOV'S PREDICTION OF THE VORTEX LATTICE. HOWEVER, IN MESOSCOPIC SAMPLES, THE VORTEX ARRANGEMENTS DEPEND ON THE INTERPLAY OF INTERVORTEX FORCES AND THE CONFINEMENT FORCES DUE TO THE SUPERCONDUCTOR BOUNDARIES. THE SITUATION BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLEX IN THE PRESENCE OF AN INHOMOGENEOUS MAGNETIC FIELD, BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF COEXISTENCE OF BOTH VORTICES AND ANTIVORTICES IN THE SAMPLE. THIS IS THE CASE IN MESOSCOPIC SUPERCONDUCTORS WITH A FERROMAGNETIC DOT ON TOP OF IT. IN THIS DISSERTATION WE STUDY VORTEX CONFIGURATIONS IN A MESOSCOPIC SUPERCONDICTING DISK WITH A MAGNETIC DIPOLE ON TOP AND ALSO THE VORTEX DYNAMICS OF THESE CONFIGURATIONS WHEN AN ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC CURRENT IS RADIALLY APPLIED. THE DOT IS MAGNETIZED OUT OF PLANE IN ORDER TO STABILIZE COMPOSITE VORTEX-ANTIVORTEX (V-AV) CONFIGURATIONS. SINCE VORTICES (ANTIVORTICES) ARE ATTRACTED (REPELLED) BY THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE, VORTICES ARE INDUCED TO REMAIN CLOSER TO THE CENTER OF THE DIS
IN THIS THESIS WE STUDIED THE MECHANISM OF EXTRACTION OF INFORMATION STORED IN A QUANTUM MEMORY CONSISTED BY A ATOMIC ENSEMBLE OF CESIUM TRAPPED AND COOLED IN A MAGNETO OPTICAL TRAP. WE CONSIDER MEMORIES CONTAINING A SINGLE EXCITATION OF A COLLECTIVE ATOMIC STATE, WHICH IS MAPPED INTO A SINGLE PHOTON DURING THE READING PROCESS. THE PROCESS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHOTON GENERATION, DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION ARE DETAILED. WE OBSERVED NON-CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE THE OPTICAL ELDS GENERATED IN THE SYSTEM. THE RESULTS ARE OBTAINED IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF MAGNETIC ELDS IN THE TRAP. FURTHERMORE, A THEORY IS DEVELOPED FOR THE WAVEPACKET OF THE EXTRACTED PHOTON, LEADING TO A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION DEPENDING ON THE KEY PARAMETERS OF THE PROBLEM. THIS THEORY IS THEN COMPARED TO A LARGE SET OF EXPERIMENTAL SITUATIONS AND A SATISFACTORY QUANTITATIVE AGREEMENT IS OBTAINED. IN THIS WAY, WE ARE ABLE TO SYSTEMATICALLY STUDY THE SATURATION AND SPECTRUM OF THE READING PROCESS, AS WELL AS CLARIFY THE ROLE OF
SINCE THE CREATION OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY BY EINSTEIN IN 1916, BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES. GREAT EFFORTS AND HUGE SUMS OF MONEY WERE INTENDED TO DETECT, ALTHOUGH HULSE AND TAYLOR HAVE RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN 1993 WHILE STUDYING THE SYSTEM PSR1913 +16 AND DETECT THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES INDIRECTLY, BUT DID NOBODY DIRECTLY. TO MAKE THIS DIRECT DETECTION IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SEVERAL DETECTORS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT NONE OF THEM ACHIEVED A POSITIVE RESULT. AMONG THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES TO BE MEASURED, IS THE VELOCITY OF SUCH WAVES. ONE OPTION IS TO MEASURE THIS CHARACTERISTIC MEASURING THE SPEED OF GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION. IN THIS WORK WE INTEND TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE EXPERIMENT TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION. THIS PROTOTYPE CONSISTS OF TWO MASSES ROTATING AT A FREQUENCY THAT EXCITES THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTOR MARIO SCHENBERG. THE BIG CHALLENGE IS TO GET TWO MASSES ROTATING AT A SPEED OF 1600HZ WITH MAGNETIC BEARING

DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS) AND OF THE CORNELL SCALE FOR DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA (CSDD) IN BRAZILIAN ELDERLY OUTPATIENTS. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 95 OUTPATIENTS WAS DIAGNOSED FOR DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION ACCORDING TO DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS- 4TH EDITION- TEXT REVISION (DSM-IV-TR), INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES- 10TH EDITION (ICD-10), AND PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION OF ALZHEIMER DISEASE (PDC-DAD) CRITERIA. RECEIVER OPERATING CURVES (ROC) WERE USED TO CALCULATE THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) AND TO ASSESS MADRS AND CSDD CUT-OFFS FOR EACH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERION. DEMENTIA WAS DIAGNOSED IN 71 OF 95 PATIENTS.

THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO GIVE AN OPTION TO THE CONTROL OF AN EXPERIMENT THAT WILL GENERATE A GRAVITATIONAL TIDE PERIODIC SIGNAL (NOT A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE) MAKING USE OF TOOLS LIKE THE FPGA DETERMINISTIC OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS. SUCH SIGNAL WILL BE DETECTED BY A SPHERICAL RESONANT-MASS GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTOR BEING BUILT IN THE PHYSICS INSTITUTE AT S�O PAULO UNIVERSITY WITH THE GOAL TO REACH A SENSITIVITY, IN H, OF 10-21, WITH A CENTRAL FREQUENCY OF 3200 HZ AND A BANDWIDTH OF +- 200 HZ. THIS DETECTOR IS NOT AN ISOLATED EXPERIMENT, BECAUSE IN THIS VERY MOMENT A NET FOR DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IS BEING BUILT AND CAN BE ALSO USED. THIS COULD BE CRUCIAL IN THE YET UNDEFINED QUESTION WHICH IS THE VELOCITY OF GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION. THE EINSTEIN GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SETS THIS VELOCITY TO BE EQUAL TO THE LIGHT VELOCITY, OTHER THEORIES SET DIFFERENT VELOCITIES BIGGER OR SMALLER THAN THE LIGHT VELOCITY.

FOR A POWER TRANSFORMER BECOME COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL MARKET IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE THE COST OF THEIR MATERIALS, WHICH USUALLY LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL SIZE OF IT, RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC SPACES. ACCORDINGLY, THE STRAY LOSSES CAN BE CONSIDERABLY HIGH, WHICH MAY RESULT IN EXCESSIVE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE AFFECTING THE LIFE TIME OF THE TRANSFORMER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES, IN AN ACCURATE WAY, THE ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATE OF STRAY LOSSES REMAINING IN THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF LARGE TRANSFORMER UNITS. VARIOUS COUNTERMEASURES REQUIRED TO REDUCE AND CONTROL THESE LOSSES, AS WELL AS TO ELIMINATE HOT SPOTS ARE DISCUSSED.

RECENT STUDIES SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF A CORRELATION BETWEEN H. PYLORI INFECTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CELLS. THE H. PYLORI UREASE ( HPU ) IS CONSIDERED A VIRULENCE FACTOR, SINCE ITS CATALYTIC ACTIVITY CREATES A MICROENVIRONMENT OF HIGHER PH, ALLOWING THE SURVIVAL OF THE PATHOGEN IN THE STOMACH. THE HPU IS ABLE TO ACTIVATE RABBIT PLATELETS INDUCED BY THEIR DENSE GRANULE SECRETION AND RELEASE OF ADP, RESULTING IN PLATELET AGGREGATION.

STUDIES INVOLVING THE HOMEOSTASIS OF ESSENTIAL MINERAL NUTRIENTS IN PLANTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM THE PLANTS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR LIFE CYCLE.

IN RICE, THESE STUDIES ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT DUE TO THE NUTRITIONAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THIS CROP. IN PLANTS, DEFICIENCY OF ONE METAL CAN LEAD TO EXCESS OF OTHERS, AND THEREFORE PLANTS MUST POSSESS MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE INFLUX OF POTENTIALLY TOXIC METALS DURING DEFICIENCY EVENTS.

THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL OF A CLOSED ENVIRONMENT PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PRODUCTIVITY, WHETHER ARISING FROM HUMAN LABOR OR THE OPERATION OF ELECTRONIC AND/OR MECHANICAL DEVICES. THE IDEAL IS AN ENVIRONMENT WITH THERMAL COMFORT AND AIR QUALITY THAT PROMOTES INTELLECTUAL AND/OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE IS A CRESCENT INTEREST FOR TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL ORIGINATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES, IN REPLACEMENT OF THE FOSSIL FUELS. THE USE OF WASTE GENERATED FROM AGRICULTURAL PROCESSES, WHICH ARE RICH IN SUGARS, IS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIOETHANOL BY THE YEAST SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE. THE PROCESSES USED FOR THIS PURPOSE, SUCH AS DILUTE ACID HYDROLYSIS, RELEASES A DIVERSITY OF SUGARS (PENTOSES AND HEXOSES), SUCH AS GLUCOSE, MANNOSE, XYLOSE AND ARABINOSE. IN ADDITION TO SUGARS, TOXIC COMPOUNDS TO CELLS ARE ALSO GENERATED, SUCH AS FURFURAL, 5-HYDROXYMETHYLFURFURAL (HMF), PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, ORGANIC ACIDS, AND ALSO HIGH OSMOTIC PRESSURE. THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF THE PROCESS DEPENDS OF THE COMPLETE CONVERSION OF MAJOR SUGARS PRESENT IH THE MEDIUM TO ETHANOL. AS S. CEREVISIAE IS NOT ABLE TO METABOLIZE PENTOSES, IT IS NECESSARY TO USE STRAINS THAT FERMENT PENTOSES AND HEXOSES TO ETHANOL, WHICH ARE RESISTANT TO THE TOXINS FORMED, IN ORDER TO THE HYDROLYZATE
DROUGHT AND ASIAN SOYBEAN RUST (ASR) ARE THE MAJOR ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESSES THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX L. MERRILL) PRODUCTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD. THE GENETIC BASIS OF DROUGHT TOLERANCE AND ASR RESISTANCE ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, AND CLARIFICATION ON HOW THE RESPONSE TO THESE STRESSES OCCUR IN SOYBEAN IS STILL A CHALLENGE. CURRENTLY, IT IS KNOWN THAT ADAPTATION IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION AT THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL LEVELS. IN THE WAY OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) HAVE BEEN FOUND TO ACT AS KEY REGULATOR FACTORS IN MANY OTHER PLANTS UNDER BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESSES. HOWEVER, IN SOYBEAN THERE WAS NO REPORT OF MIRNAS RESPONSIVE TO THESE CONDITIONS. IN THIS CONTEXT, OUR GOAL WAS TO IDENTIFY NEW MIRNAS IN SOYBEAN, CHARACTERIZE SOME OF THE MIRNA EXPRESSION PATTERNS DURING BOTH STRESSES, AND TRY TO DETECT TARGET GENES FOR THE MIRNAS. IN THIS WAY, THIS THESIS WAS DIVIDED IN CHAPTERS WHICH PRESENT THE DIFFERENT WORKS THAT WERE D
THE BRAZILIAN GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTOR, MARIO SCHENBERG, IS LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS OF MATERIALS AND MECHANICS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF S�O PAULO (USP), ITS MASS (OR ANTENNA) HAS SPHERICAL 1.15 TONS AND 65 CM IN DIAMETER AND CONSISTS OF A COPPER-ALUMINUM ALLOY CONTAINING 94% COPPER AND 6% ALUMINUM. TO BE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED BY THE PROJECT GROUP GR�VITON PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT SENSITIVITY TO CAPTURE SIGNALS AMPLITUDES OF THE ORDER OF 10-22 HZ-1/2, IN THE RANGE OF 3000-3400HZ. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THE GROUP IS STUDYING WAYS TO MINIMIZE THE NOISE PRESENT IN THE DETECTOR. THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER AIMS TO ALLEVIATE THE NOISE EXISTING IN THE VIBRATIONAL TRANSDUCERS COUPLED TO THE DETECTOR TO THIS END, WILL BE USED THE ASSOCIATION OF TWO CAPACITORS IN SERIES TO THE TRANSDUCERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING THE DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES. A CAPACITOR IS CONNECTED TO A SPRING SYSTEM TO ADJUST THE SIZE OF THE GAP (DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POLE THAT CARRIES MICROWAVE REENTRANT
TUMOR CELLS ARE CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO NUTRIENTS AND OXYGEN CONCENTRATION FLUCTUATIONS AT TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT. THROUGH ACTIVATION OF DIFFERENT SIGNALING PATHWAYS, TUMOR CELLS UNDERGO METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING TO TOLERATE HOSTILE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT. ONE OF THE ACTIVATED SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN SUCH CONDITIONS IS AUTOPHAGY, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE CENTRAL MECHANISMS OF CELL SURVIVAL IN STRESS CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, MANY ANTICANCER DRUGS, LIKE ALKYLANTING AGENTS, HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN AUTOPHAGY INDUCTION. DESPITE AUTOPHAGY CONTRIBUTION TO CELL SURVIVAL, THE AUTOPHAGIC PATHWAY ACTIVATION FOR PROLONGED PERIODS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CELL DEATH, WHICH CREATES EXTENSIVELY DEBATES ABOUT THE ROLE OF AUTOPHAGY IN CANCER. IN THE PRESENT WORK WE INTENDED TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF AUTOPHAGY INDUCED IN COLORECTAL CANCER CELLS HCT116 GROWN CONTINUOUSLY IN LOW GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION AND TREATED WITH THE ALKYLATING AGENT OXALIPLATIN. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT AUTOPHAGY INDUCED IN HCT116 CELLS IN
RICE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURES IN THE WORLD, WITH NEARLY HALF OF THE POPULATION EATING RICE EVERY DAY. HOWEVER, THE RICE GRAIN IS VERY POOR IN MICRONUTRIENTES SUCH AS FE AND ZN, THE TWO MINERALS MOST OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE HUMAN DIET. IN PLANTS, BOTH FE AND ZN SHOULD BE ACQUIRED FROM THE SOIL, DISTRIBUTED AND STORED WITHIN THE PLANT, AND THEIR CONCENTRATIONS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN SUFFICIENT BUT NON-TOXIC LEVELS. UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS AND PROTEINS INVOLVED IN FE AND ZN HOMEOSTASIS IN PLANTS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT AGRICULTURE, IMPROVING THE USE OF MICRONUTRIENTES BY PLANTS, AS WELL AS INDICATE APPROACHES FOR GRAIN BIOFORTIFICATION TO INCREASE THEIR NUTRITIONAL QUALITY. IN THIS WORK, WE IDENTIFIED E CHARACTERIZED AT THE GENOMIC LEVEL A NEW FAMILY OF PROTEINS, ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR LIKE (ZIFL), INCLUDING THEIR ORGANIZATION IN THE GENOME, SEQUENCE ANALYSES AND GENE EXPRESSION REGULATION IN RICE. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ZIFL FAMILY UNDERWENT AN EXPANSION PROCESS IN THE MONOCOT LINEAGE

GLIOMAS ARE THE MAJORITY OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TUMOURS, BEING GLIOBLASTOMA THE MOST MALIGN AMONG THEM. THE TREATMENT FOR THESE TUMORS IS STILL INEFFICIENT AND SURVIVAL AVERAGE OF PATIENTS IS APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR AFTER DIAGNOSIS. SURGICAL REMOVAL, IF POSSIBLE, FOLLOWED BY RADIOTHERAPY AND CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE STANDARD TREATMENT. THE TREND IS THAT CHEMOTHERAPY ASSUMES A GREATER ROLE, SINCE IT ALLOWS THE ACTIVATION OF ANTITUMOUR MECHANISMS, SUCH AS CELLULAR SENESCENCE. THIS MECHANISM HAS POTENTIAL TO INDUCE IRREVERSIBLE LOSS OF DIVISION ABILITY IN TUMOR CELLS. RESVERATROL AND QUERCETIN, TWO NATURAL POLYPHENOLS, ARE ABLE TO INDUCE SENESCENCE IN DIFFERENT CANCER MODELS, INCLUDING GLIOBLASTOMA. RESVERATROL AND QUERCETINE ARE MOLECULES WITH PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS AND LEADS TO SIRT1 ACTIVATION. SIRT1 IS A HISTONE DEACETYLASE (HDAC) WHICH HAS BEEN LINKED POSITIVELY TO CANCER DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, WE ANALYZED THE ABILITY OF SODIUM BUTYRATE, A HDAC CLASS I AND II INHIBITOR COMBINED WITH RESVERATROL OR QUERCETIN TO I
THE FREE RADICAL THEORY OF AGING POSTULATES THAT AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) AND REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES (RNS) AND ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES WOULD BE A DETERMINING FACTOR IN SENESCENCE. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IS A COSTLY ACTIVITY FOR THE ORGANISM, AND REQUIRES A HIGHER ENERGY INTAKE AND THIS INCREASE OF ENERGY LEVELS TENDS TO GENERATE MORE REACTIVE SPECIES. TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION AND OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OVERALL AGING PROCESS WE USED THE GONADS OF MALE WISTAR RATS (RATTUS NORVEGICUS), WITH FOOD AND WATER AD LIBITUM AND CYCLE LIGHT / DARK 12 HOURS IN FOUR DIFFERENT AGES - 3, 6, 12 AND 24 MONTHS, REARED IN CONDITIONS WITH (PAIRED WITH FEMALES) AND WITHOUT (GROUPED WITH OTHER MALES) REPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY. WE EVALUATED THE ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMATIC DEFENSES (SOD, GPX, GST AND CONSUMPTION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE), NON-ENZYMATIC DEFENSES (VITAMIN C AND GLUTATHIONE) AND, ALSO EVALUATE THE OXIDATIVE DAMAGE (INDEX OF LIPID PEROXIDATION, PROTEIN CARBONYLATION), NITRITES AND NITRATES LEVELS,
THE ADVENT OF THE DEEP SEQUENCING APPROACH ENABLED A BETTER CHARACTERIZATION OF SMALL RNAS, SUCH AS MICRORNAS (MIRNAS), THE WELL-KNOWN SMALL RNA CLASS, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW CLASSES LIKE THE TRANSFER RNA-DERIVED FRAGMENTS (TRFS). THE SMALL RNAS CAN ACT AS NEGATIVE REGULATORS OF GENE EXPRESSION OF THEIR TARGET TRANSCRIPT. THIS MECHANISM, KNOWN AS POST TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE SILENCING (PTGS), INVOLVES DICING OF THE TARGET TRANSCRIPT, OR TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION. IN SOYBEAN, THE MICRORNAS ACTING ON SEED GERMINATION ARE UNKNOWN. THESE MIRNAS WERE DESCRIBED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS THESIS. USING TWO DEEP SEQUENCING LIBRARIES, RELATIVE TO THE MATURE SEEDS AND A COMBINATION OF GERMINATING SEEDS (3, 5 AND 7 DAYS). A TOTAL OF 178 MIRNAS WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING 36 NEW ONES. EIGHT MIRNAS HAD TARGETS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO SEED GERMINATION INCLUDING SOME ACTING ON AUXIN AND GIBBERELLIN PATHWAYS, LIPID AND NITROGEN METABOLISM AND REDOX HOMEOSTASIS, AND WERE VALIDATED BY DEGRADOME ANALYSIS.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY WORLDWIDE, DESPITE BEING PREVENTABLE AND TREATABLE. RESULTING FROM AN ABNORMAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE TO INHALED TOXIC PARTICLES, COPD IS CHARACTERIZED BY PROGRESSIVE AIRFLOW LIMITATION WHICH HAS POOR RESPONSIVENESS TO PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY. IN THIS CASE-CONTROL STUDY, INVOLVING 51 PATIENTS WITH COPD AND 51 CONTROLS, WE AIMED TO ASSESS AND TO QUANTIFY DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR CAPACITY AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS IN THE MODULATION OF DNA DAMAGE. ENDOGENOUS DNA DAMAGE LEVELS WERE DETERMINED IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD BY COMET ASSAY IN ALKALINE AND NEUTRAL VERSIONS. DNA DAMAGE-INDUCED VERSION WITH ALKYLATING METHYLMETHANE SULFONATE AGENT (MMS) WAS EVALUATED FOR 1 AND 3 HOURS BY COMET ASSAY IN ALKALINE VERSION. THE RESIDUAL DAMAGE AFTER THE 3-HOUR MMS TREATMENT WAS CALCULATED RELATED TO 1 HOUR (100% DAMAGE INDUCED), FOR EACH SUBJECT. LIPID PEROXIDATION WAS ASSESSED BY MEASURING THIOBARBITURIC ACID REACTIVE SPECIES (TBARS) IN BLOOD
THE CRYPTOCOCCUS COMPLEX HAS 37 SPECIES DESCRIBED, FROM WHICH C. NEOFORMANS AND C. GATTII STAND OUT FOR THEIR ABILITY TO CAUSE DISEASE IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS. TO PREVENT INFECTION WITH PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS, HOST MAY REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF NUTRIENTS IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS NUTRITIONAL IMMUNITY. FURTHERMORE, IT IS WELL DESCRIBED THAT ESSENTIAL METALS HAVE CENTRAL ROLES RELATED TO THE REGULATION OF EXPRESSION OF VIRULENCE FACTORS IN PATHOGENIC CRYPTOCOCCUS SPECIES. MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) ARE IMPORTANT MEDIATORS OF GENE EXPRESSION IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL STRESSES, INCLUDING METAL DEPRIVATION OR TOXICITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT MICRORNAS OR MIRNAS-LIKE EXPRESSION IN C. GATTII. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO PROFILE MIRNAS PRODUCED BY C. GATTII DURING IRON AND ZINC DEPRIVATION. C. GATTII R265 CELLS WERE INCUBATED IN THREE CONDITIONS: ZINC DEPRIVATION, IRON DEPRIVATION AND CONTROL CONDITION. THE SEQUENCES OF SMALL RNAS WERE OBTAINED BY RNA-SEQ. TO IDENTIFY MIRNAS OR MIRNAS-LIKE IN C. GATTII, NON-RED
IN THIS WORK WE SUMMARIZE THE STUDY BUNDLING OF WIRES IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLANAR REGION. WE APPROACH THE PROBLEM FROM A THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW, USING TECHNIQUES OF CONFORMAL FIELD, AND SCALE PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL, IN THE REGIME OF RIGID PACKAGING, ARE DERIVED, SO THAT THE CRITICAL EXPONENTS FOR ELASTIC ENERGY AND THE NUMBER OF BONDS OF FORMING ARE OBTAINED. THE RESULTS SHOW REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH DATA COMING FROM EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS. ALSO OUTLINED AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THIS SYSTEM AND GRAVITATION IN TWO DIMENSIONS, VIA LIOUVILLE GRAVITY.
IN THIS DISSERTATION, WE ANALYZED THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONDENSED PHASE AND THE PHASE TRANSITION OF DISORDERED Q-STATE POTTS MODEL, DEFINED IN A FAMILY OF DIAMOND HIERARCHICAL LATTICE WITH SCALING FACTOR B = 3. THE CRITICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE MODEL WAS STUDIED USING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE REAL SPACE RENORMALIZATION GROUP. THUS, WE DERIVED THE EXACT RENORMALIZATION EQUATION FOR THE THERMAL TRANSMISSIVITIES AND A RECURRENCE EQUATION BETWEEN THE LOCAL MAGNETIZATIONS OF SITES BELONGING TO SUCCESSIVE HIERARCHIES FOR MODELS DEFINED ON LATTICES WITH AN ARBITRARY FRACTAL DIMENSION D F = LOG(BP)=LOGB AND SCALING FACTOR B = 3. WE STUDIED PARTICULARLY THE DISORDERED CASE WITH RANDOM COMPETING INTERACTIONS AMONG NEAREST NEIGHBORS SITES, WHICH RECEIVES THE DESIGNATION OF POTTS SPINS GLASSES. THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURES FOR VARIOUS VALUES OF P WERE ESTIMATED BY THE METHOD OF THE RESERVOIRS CONSIDERING FOUR INITIAL DISTINCT PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS FOR THE COUPLINGS: GAUSSIAN, DELTA-BIMODAL, EXPONENTIAL AND UNIFORM. THE NUMER
ELECTRONIC DEVICES PROVIDE COMFORT, PRODUCTIVITY AND SAFETY FOR THE MODERN SOCIETY. HOWEVER, THEY ARE USUALLY CHARACTERIZED AS NONLINEAR LOAD THAT MEANS THAT THEY TRULY GENERATE CURRENT HARMONICS. ON THE OTHER HAND, HARMONICS GIVE ORIGIN TO SEVERAL PROBLEMS TO THE POWER GRID, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO TRANSFORMER TO WHICH CURRENT HARMONICS EXCESSIVELY INCREASE WINDING LOSSES SINCE MOST OF TRANSFORMERS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH CURRENT HARMONICS. THIS EFFECT IS NAMED ADDITIONAL LOSSES. THIS WORK PRESENTS A THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW TO RATE A POWER TRANSFORMER TO SUPPLY A NONLINEAR LOAD. IT STARTS WITH A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REGARDING HARMONICS, FOLLOWED BY ANALYSES OF INTERACTION OF POWER TRANSFORMER AND NONLINEAR LOAD, CURRENT HARMONIC EFFECTS ON POWER TRANSFORMER, ANALYSIS OF ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN POWER TRANSFORMER AND VARIATION OF THE ADDITIONAL LOSSES DUE TO FREQUENCY. THE MAIN METHODS FOR CORRECTION OF ADDITIONAL LOSSES ARE THEN DESCRIBED THROUGH WHAT IS KNOWN IN BRAZIL, NORTH

INDUSTRIAL ENZYMES HAVE A WORLD MARKET OF MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. KERATINASES ARE AMONG THESE ENZYMES. THEY HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR USE IN TANNERY. THE KERATINASE KERS14, PRODUCED BY BACILLUS SUBTILIS S14, DIFFERS FROM OTHERS KERATINASES BECAUSE IT CAN DEPILATE LEATHER WITHOUT DAMAGING COLLAGEN. DESPITE THIS GREAT BIOTECHNOLOGICAL POTENTIAL, ITS LOW THERMAL STABILITY AT 50 �C IS AN UNDESIRABLE PROPERTY FOR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION. IN ORDER TO INCREASE KERS14 THERMAL STABILITY, TWO STRATEGIES WERE ADOPTED: CHANGES IN WILD�TYPE MICROORGANISM GROWTH CONDITIONS AND PRODUCING RECOMBINANT MUTANT ENZYMES. IN FIRST STRATEGY, B. SUBTILIS S14 WERE GROWN IN FEATHER MEAL 1.5% AND CACL2 1 %.

THIS WORK GREW OUT OF AN INTEREST IN KNOWING THE SONGS OF ALBERTO NEPOMUCENO MORE DEEPLY, ENCOURAGED MAINLY BY THE LACK OF DISCLOSURE OF THIS REPERTOIRE IN RECITALS IN THE CITY OF RECIFE - PERNAMBUCO. DEALING WITH SONGS IN PORTUGUESE, WAS SOUGHT TO KNOW HOW NEPOMUCENO'S DEFENSE OF THE USE OF THE VERNACULAR IN CLASSICAL SINGING OCCURRED, CONSIDERING THAT AT HIS TIME THE ITALIAN AND FRENCH LANGUAGES WERE RECOGNIZED AS SUITABLE FOR THIS KIND OF PERFORMANCE.

LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES INFECTIONS HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY REPORTED IN MANY FOOD POISONING OUTBREAKS AROUND THE WORLD. THEREFORE, THE CONCERN ABOUT PROTECTING LARGELY-SCALE FOOD PRODUCTS FROM THESE PATHOGENS HAS BEEN RISING OVER THE YEARS. ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT STRATEGIES IS USING BACTERIOCINS AS A CONSERVING AGENT, PREVENTING THE GROWTH OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA DURING THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCT. NISIN IS A WELL-KNOWN BACTERIOCIN, WHICH HAS BEEN APPLIED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY FOR MANY YEARS. ITS MAIN ANTIMICROBIAL MECHANISM IS BASED IN FORMING A CELL MEMBRANE PORE CREATOR COMPLEX, WHICH COUPLED WITH A CELL WALL PRECURSOR (LIPID II), LEADS TO THE LEAKAGE OF ESSENTIAL CELL LIFE COMPOUNDS AND THE LOSS OF ELECTROLYTIC STABILITY, CAUSING THE CELL DEATH. HOWEVER, RECENT EVIDENCES LEAD TO AN ALTERNATIVE, BUT STILL UNKNOWN, CELL DEATH MECHANISM. ONE INTERESTING APPROACH IS ANALYZING THE CELL PROCESSES (COMPARED TO A NON-NISIN TREATED CONDITION) BY A PROTEOMIC APPROACH. THE L. MONOCYTOGENES CE
UREASES (EC 3.5.1.5) ARE NIQUEL DEPENDENT ENZYMES THAT HYDROLYSE UREA INTO AMMONIUM AND CARBON DIOXIDE.

CANAVALIA ENSIFORMIS SEEDS ARE SOURCE OF UREASE ISOFORMS, LIKE CANATOXIN (CNTX) AND JACKBEAN UREASE (JBU). CNTX IS A NEUROTOXIC PROTEIN, DISPLAYING SEVERAL BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AFTER INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION IN RATS OR MICE, INCLUDING PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND PLATELET AGGREGATION ACTIVITY, AND CONVULSIONS FOLLOWED BY DEATH OF THE ANIMALS. CNTX ALSO PRESENTS INSECTICIDAL AND FUNGITOXIC EFFECTS, WHICH ARE PROBABLY RELEVANT FOR DEFENSE MECHANISMS OF THE SOURCE PLANT. AFTER SOME YEARS OF STUDIES, IT WAS FOUND THAT JBU ALSO SHARE THESE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ENTOMOTOXIC AND ANTIFUNGAL EFFECTS, ACTIVATION OF PLATELETS AND INFLAMMATORY CELLS, INCLUDING LETHALITY IN RATS AND MICE (INTRAVENOUSLY). IN THE SEARCH FOR THE INSECTICIDAL MODE OF ACTION, AN UREASE FRAGMENT LETHAL TO INSECTS WAS IDENTIFI
CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS AFFECTS IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED T CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND THEREFORE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENS. C. NEOFORMANS HAS A REPERTOIRE OF VIRULENCE FACTORS THAT ALLOWS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF THE INFECTION IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, CAUSING MENINGOENCEPHALITIS. THE VIRULENCE FACTORS OF CRYPTOCOCCUS HAS BEEN SUBJECT OF MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWED THE INVOLVEMENT OF GENE PRODUCTS IN THE INFECTION PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE TREATMENT OF CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGOENCEPHALITIS CONSISTS OF ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY AND DISPLAYS MANY SIDE EFFECTS. FOR THESE REASONS, NEW THERAPIES ARE BEING ADDRESSED, IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE ACTIVATION OF THE HOST IMMUNE SYSTEM TO OVERCOME THE INFECTION. TO DEVELOP THESE THERAPIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY MOLECULES THAT STIMULATE CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE. HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS FROM MANY PATHOGENS HAVE BEEN USED AS A TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF MANY HUMANS INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THESE PROTEINS STI

THE OF THE FUNGUS METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE TO CONTROL TICKS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN SEVERAL IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW REPORTS OF ASSAYS IN FIELD CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE REAL APPLICABILITY OF THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. THUS AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF M. ANISOPLIAE TO CONTROL RHIPICEPHALUS MICROPLUS UNDER LABORATORY AND FIELD CONDITIONS. FIRSTLY THE COMPATIBILITY OF M. ANISOPLIAE (STRAIN E6) TO ACARICIDES WAS TESTED IN VITRO USING FIVE COMMERCIAL ACARICIDES: AMITRAZ, CYPERMETHRIN, CHLORPYRIPHOS AND TWO ASSOCIATIONS OF SYNTHETIC PYRETHROID AND ORGANOPHOSPHATE (SP+OP). IN GENERAL, THE ACARICIDES ONLY DISPLAYED MILD EFFECTS ON FUNGUS VIABILITY. THE LOWER FUNGAL VIABILITY WAS WITH AMITRAZ AND CHLORPYRIPHOS, APPROXIMATELY 63% OF FUNGUS VIABILITY AT 48 HOURS POST-MIXTURE AND 67% AT 96 HOURS, RESPECTIVELY. SECONDLY, THE EFFICACY OF M. ANISOPLIAE (STRAIN E6) TO CONTROL A MULTIACARICIDE-RESISTANT STRAIN OF R. MICROPLUS (JAGUAR) WAS EVALUATED, IN VITRO AND UNDER
BRASSICA NAPUS (CANOLA) IS THE THIRD LARGEST OILSEED CROP IN THE WORLD, PROVIDING APPROXIMATELY 13% OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF VEGETABLE OIL. DURING SEED DEVELOPMENT, B. NAPUS BUILD UP STORAGE RESERVES IN SPECIFIC STAGES AND TISSUES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE RESERVES ARE MADE UP OF LIPIDS (30�40%) AND PROTEINS (17�26%) THAT ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY STORED IN THE COTYLEDONS OF THE MATURING EMBRYO. MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) PLAY ESSENTIAL ROLES IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SEED DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT AND THE TIMING OF SEEDS MATURATION. THE FUNCTION OF THESE ENDOGENOUS SMALL NON-CODING RNAS (SRNAS) IS TO REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION, MAINLY THROUGH CLEAVAGE AND TRANSLATION INHIBITION OF TARGET. SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF MIRNAS IN SEEDS FROM B. NAPUS, BUT TEMPORAL EXPRESSION AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS OF MIRNAS IN SEEDS OF B. NAPUS, ESPECIALLY DURING SEED MATURATION, ARE UNKNOWN. TO UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EXPRESSION PATTERNS OF MIRNAS DURING SEED DEVELOPMENT BY RT-QPCR, THIS W

CRYPTOCOCCOSIS IS AN INVASIVE FUNGAL DISEASE CAUSED MAINLY BY PATHOGENIC SPECIES CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS AND CRYPTOCOCCUS GATTII. RECENT EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT INFECTION WITH C. GATTII DEVELOPS MORE FREQUENTLY PULMONARY CRYPTOCOCCOMAS, WHILE C. NEOFORMANS ESTABLISHES MAINLY NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGES. ALTHOUGH EXISTS THIS ASSOCIATION, THE MECHANISM OF DISSEMINATION OF THESE SPECIES IS NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD, INSTIGATING THE USE OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE INFECTIONS. ALTERNATIVELY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOLUMINESCENT ORGANISMS HAS ALLOWED THE REAL-TIME MONITORING OF INFECTION IN ANIMAL MODELS. IN THIS STUDY, DIFFERENT STRATEGIES WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT STRAINS OF C. NEOFORMANS AND C. GATTII EXPRESSING RENILLA LUCIFERASE REPORTER GENE WITHOUT SUCCESS.

AMOXICILLIN IS A PENICILLIN SYNTHETIC USE BOTH IN HOSPITAL, RESIDENTIAL AND VETERINARY. THE INDISCRIMINATE USE OF THIS DRUG MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO BOTH PEOPLE AND FOR NATURE. FROM THE 70'S BEGAN STUDIES ON THE QUANTIFICATION OF DRUGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT NOT ONLY ANTIBIOTICS BUT ANY PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY THE PRESENCE AND LEVELS OF AMOXICILLIN IN WATER FROM TWO RIVERS IN THE SOUTHWEST REGION: RIO WART LOCATED IN VIT�RIA DA CONQUISTA AGUA FRIA RIVER AND THE TOWN OF BAR SHACK. FOR THIS EXPERIMENT WE USED A TECHNIQUE PHYSICO - CHEMICAL SEPARATION, HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH UV-VISIBLE DETECTOR (HPLC-UV). THE STUDY WAS BASED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VALIDATION OF CHROMATOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS SPECIFICITY, LINEARITY, PRECISION, ACCURACY, LIMIT OF QUANTIFICATION AND DETECTION LIMIT ACCORDING TO RE NO. 899, OF MAY 29, 2003 THE NATIONAL AGENCY FOR SANITARY SURVEILLANCE ( ANVISA).

IN THIS STUDY, WAS INVESTIGATED THE ESTERIFICATION REACTION OF A SECONDARY ALCOHOL, MENTHOL, WITH ACETIC ACID, IN THE PRESENCE OF DODECAPHOSPHOTUNGSTIC ACID SUPPORTED ON SILICA AT 30% (W/W) HPW/SIO2. THE REACTION WAS CARRIED OUT IN TOLUENE AS SOLVENT WHICH IS A LESS TOXIC AND CHEAPER SOLVENT AND NECESSARY, AS HETEROPOLYCOMPOUNDS ARE SOLUBLE IN POLAR SOLVENTS CONTAINING OXYGEN. THE CATALYST SHOWED GOOD ACTIVITY, ALLOWING FOR CONVERSIONS CLOSE TO 100% IN EXCESS OF ACETIC ACID, IN JUST ABOUT TWO HOURS OF REACTION. THE MOLAR RATIO 4:1 ACETIC ACID:MENTHOL WAS THE BEST COMPOSITION ACCORDING TO BEFOREHAND CATALYTIC TESTS. THE PRODUCT ESTER, MENTHYL ACETATE WAS IDENTIFIED BY GC-MS USING THE NIST 11 LIBRARY. THE HPW/SIO2 WAS CHARACTERIZED BY X-RAY FLUORESCENCE, FTIR, XRD, UV-VIS, CONFIRMING THE PRESENCE OF PRIMARY (KEGGIN ANION) AND SECONDARY STRUCTURES OF HPW ADSORBED ON THE SILICA SURFACE.

"MYCOPLASMA HYOPNEUMONIAE IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST BACTERIA FOUND IN NATURE, PRESENTING A REDUCED GENOME WITH A HIGH A+T CONTENT AND NO CELL WALL. THIS BACTERIUM IS THE ETIOLOGICAL AGENT OF SWINE ENZOOTIC PNEUMONIA, A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT AFFECTS HERDS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GREAT ECONOMIC LOSSES. TO INVESTIGATE THE PATHOGENESIS OF M. HYOPNEUMONIAE IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GENETIC MECHANISMS, HOWEVER, DESPITE THE GENOME SEQUENCING OF SEVERAL STRAINS (7448, J, 232 AND 168), LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE AND CONTROL THE GENE EXPRESSION IN THIS BACTERIUM, ESPECIALLY ABOUT REGULATORY PROTEINS. TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS ARE PROTEINS THAT BIND TO DNA PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION UNDER DIFFERENT METABOLIC STIMULI OR GROWTH CONDITIONS. THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE PROTEINS IN M. HYOPNEUMONIAE IS SCARCE
THE GENUS AZOSPIRILLUM IS KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO PROMOTE PLANT GROWTH, MAINLY THROUGH BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN FIXATION AND METABOLISM OF PLANT HORMONES. DESPITE MANY YEARS OF STUDIES WITH THESE MICROORGANISMS, THE FIRST COMPLETE GENOME BECAME AVAILABLE ONLY IN 2010, AND AZOSPIRILLUM SP. B510 HAS BEEN SELECTED DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO ACT AS AN ENDOPHYTE. THE A. AMAZONENSE SPECIE, ISOLATED FROM GRASSES OF ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE SUCH AS RICE AND SUGAR CANE, POSSESSES CHARACTERISTICS THAT ALLOW ITS USE IN ACIDIC SOILS, BESIDES ACTING IN XENOBIOTICS METABOLISM, WHICH HAS HIGHLIGHTED ITS POTENTIAL FOR BIOREMEDIATION. WITH THE COLLABORATION OF PROJETO INTEGRADO GENOMA SUL, OUR GROUP CONDUCTED A PARTIAL SEQUENCING OF A. AMAZONENSE GENOME. GENES LINKED TO NITROGEN AND CARBON FIXATION, QUORUM SENSING, CHEMOTAXIS AND BACTERIAL RESISTANCE WERE INITIALLY CHARACTERIZED IN A TOTAL OF 3,319 ANNOTATED ORFS. IN THE PRESENT WORK, WE PERFORMED THE PREDICTION AND ANNOTATION FOR THE COMPLETE SEQUENCE OF THE CONTIGS ALREADY DEPOSITED FOR
THE NITROREDUCTASE FAMILY COMPRISES A GROUP OF FLAVINE MONONUCLEOTIDE (FMN)-DEPENDENT ENZYMES ABLE TO METABOLIZE NITROSUBSTITUTED COMPOUNDS USING THE REDUCING POTENTIAL OF NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD(P)H). NITROREDUCTASE PROTEINS PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE ACTIVATION OF NITROCOMPOUNDS AND HAVE RECEIVED ATTENTION IN RECENT DECADES BASED ON THEIR ROLE IN MEDIATING NITROSUBSTITUTED COMPOUND TOXICITY, BY ITS BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATION FOR BIOREMEDIATION BIOCATALYSIS, AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE IN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC TUMOR TREATMENT, ABLATION OF SPECIFIC CELLS AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE. DUE TO ITS RELEVANCE, DIFFERENT BACTERIAL NITROREDUCTASES HAVE BEEN PURIFIED, AND THEIR BIOCHEMICAL, KINETIC PARAMETERS AND STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. NITROREDUCTASES CAN BE FOUND WITHIN BACTERIAL SPECIES AND, IN A LESS EXTEND, IN EUKARYOTES, SUCH AS FUNGI, PROTOZOAN AND MAMMALIAN. A FEATURE OF THE NITROREDUCTASE FAMILY IS OUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ITS BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION. THEREFORE, NEW HYPOTHESES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED
"ALTHOUGH THE TERM ""RHEUMATOLOGY"" HAVE BEEN PROPOSED ONLY IN 1940, WITH DUTIES RELATED TO RHEUMATOLOGY BEING DEFINED ONLY 9 YEARS LATER, THE DISEASES ENCOMPASSED BY THIS MEDICAL SPECIALTY WERE PRESENT SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, CAUSING SEVERE IMPAIRMENT TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY THEM. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS CHARACTERIZED AS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, INFLAMMATORY, CHRONIC AND DISABLING, AFFECTING THE JOINTS WITH THEIR REFLECTIONS IN THE MAIN SYNOVIUM, WITH SYMMETRICAL PATTERN AND CLEAR SYMPTOMS.

PANIC DISORDER (PD) PATIENTS REPORT VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF AUTONOMIC MANIFESTATIONS DURING PANIC ATTACKS (PA). A MAJOR SYMPTOM, HOWEVER, IS THE PRESENCE OF ANXIETY CONCERNING THE OCCURRENCE OF PANIC SYMPTOMS AND STIMULI PERCEIVED AS THREATENING TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. PD PATIENTS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO INTEROCEPTIVE CUES THAT TRIGGER AUTONOMIC CHANGES AND THEREFORE, ANXIETY AND PA. FOR NUMEROUS PATIENTS WITH PD, EXERCISING MAY BE CONSIDERED ANXIOGENIC, GIVEN THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE AUTONOMIC ACTIVATION TRIGGERED BY EXERCISE AND PANIC SYMPTOMS, CONTRIBUTING TO A PHOBIC AVOIDANCE OF THIS ACTIVITY. A POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE THE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, ASSOCIATED TO A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, AS WELL AS ITS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE.

THE DESIGN PROCESS HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT DEFINES THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS. HOWEVER, DESIGN PLANNING AND CONTROL IN CONSTRUCTION ARE OFTEN DEFICIENT, ESPECIALLY IN RAPID AND COMPLEX PROJECTS OF PREFABRICATED SYSTEMS, TYPICAL OF AN ENGINEER-TO-ORDER (ETO) SITUATION. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DESIGN PROCESS, MANY COMPANIES HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE EFFORT IN IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPLES OF LEAN PRODUCTION, BUT WITHOUT FIRST STABILIZING THE WORKFLOW. THE LAST PLANNER SYSTEM (LPS) HELPS PROTECTING THE PRODUCTION, REDUCING PROCESS VARIABILITY. THIS RESEARCH WORK AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE DESIGN PROCESS, PROPOSING A DESIGN PLANNING MODEL FOR ETO COMPANIES. THUS, AN EMPIRICAL STUDY, BASED ON THE STEPS OF CONSTRUCTIVE RESEARCH, WAS CARRIED OUT AT A METAL STRUCTURE COMPANY. INITIALLY, THE LPS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO DESIGN TEAMS. THEN, THE REFINED LPS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN FOUR ADDITIONAL DESIGN TEAMS. FINALLY, A DESIGN PLANNING MODEL FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS OF
ROCK MEDIA ARE COMPOSED BY BLOCKS OF INTACT ROCK AND DISCONTINUITIES. DISCONTINUITIES REPRESENT ZONES OF LOW STIFFNESS, WHERE THE MASS PROPERTIES OF THE ROCK ARE DEGRADED, WITH REDUCED RESISTANCE. THEY ALSO PROVIDE WAYS FOR FLUID FLOW WITHIN THE ROCK. THE STUDY OF COUPLED MECHANICAL-HYDRAULIC BEHAVIOR EXISTING IN POROUS MEDIA IS PERFOMED BY POROELASTICITY, WHICH RELATES THE STRESS AND STRAIN FIELDS IN A ROCK MASS GENERATED BY THE MECHANICAL DEFORMATION OF THE SKELETON AND THE ACTION OF PRESSURIZED FLUID IN THE PORES. A MICROMECHANICS APPROACH ALLOWS TO EXTEND THE CLASSICAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY OF POROELASTICITY TO THE CASE OF JOINTS THAT ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER STRESSES ALONG THEIR FACES. IN THIS CONTEXT, A HETEROGENEOUS ROCK MEDIA IS REPLACED BY AN EQUIVALENT HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM BY APPLYING THE MICRO-MACRO APPROACH FROM THE THEORY OF HOMOGENIZATION, WHICH ALLOWS THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ROCK MASS. IT IS SHOWN THAT, FOR SOME GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE JOINTS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBT

OFTEN ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICAL ILLNESSES, SUCH AS HEADACHES, MUSCLE ACHES, GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS, OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, IN PARTICULAR, ANXIETY DISORDERS AND MAJOR DEPRESSION. WHEN UNTREATED, THE ANXIETY DISORDERS TEND TO REMAIN THROUGHOUT THE PATIENT'S LIFE, AFFECTING DIFFERENT AREAS, AND CAUSING SUFFERING AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF PROVEN EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, SUCH AS SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF SEROTONIN REUPTAKE AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATIENTS, EVEN WHEN PROPERLY TREATED, DO NOT FULLY REMIT OR HAVE RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS.

SINCE THE WIDESPREAD USE OF GLYPHOSATE IN THE WORLD, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP METHODS OF EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS OF HERBICIDE IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATRICES. A LARGE NUMBER OF METHODOLOGIES ARE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF GLYPHOSATE IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES, INCLUDING THE COMBINATION OF CHROMATOGRAPHIC, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC AND POTENTIOMETRIC. THE INTEREST FOR RAPID, EFFICIENT, SENSITIVE AND INEXPENSIVE ANALYTICAL METHODS TO DETERMINE RESIDUAL GLYPHOSATE IN WATER BODIES IS INCREASING.

"THE CHANGE IN PSYCHIATRIC CARE HAS SHIFTED THE MAIN SOURCE OF CARE FROM HOSPITAL TO THE COMMUNITY CAUSING MAJOR CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN BRAZIL, AND THE DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS DETERMINED THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW GROUP OF USERS IN COMMUNITY SERVICE: CHRONIC PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CONDITIONS. THE PSYCHIATRIC REFORM PROCESS LED TO A GROWING NEED TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT. ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT COMMUNITY HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CONCERN FOR PATIENTS COMING OUT OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS, AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND MANAGERS.

THIS RESEARCH HAS A DESCRITIVE CHARACTER AND OUR PURPOSE WAS MAKING AN EXPLANATION ABOUT THE PHENOMENON NAMED 'ASPECT'. IN ORDER TO REACH OUR OBJECTIVE, WE HAVE MADE USE OF THE THEORICAL ASSUMPTION IN FORMAL LINGUISTICS, PARTICULARLY THOSE PRESENTED BY THE WORKS OF CASTILHO (1968) AND TRAVAGLIA (1981). IN ADDITION, WE ALSO BASED OUR ARGUMENTS AT THE CONCEPTS OF COSTA (1990), OLIVEIRA (2003) AND COR�A (2005). OUR FOCUS WAS CONSTRUCTING THE JOB IN ORDER TO MAKE EASIER THE ENDEAVORS OF THE FUTURE ASPECT'S RESEARCHERS. ON THE FIRST PART WE DISCOURSED ABOUT THE RELATION AMONG TENSE AND ASPECT. FUTHERMORE, WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED SENTENCES WHERE THERE WAS ASPECT AND TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE WHICH ARE THE CORRECT WAYS TO INTERPRET IT. AFTER THAT, ON THE SECOND PART, WE PRESENTED THE BOARD OF ASPECTUAL REALIZATION BUILT BY CASTILHO AND TRAVAGLIA. ON THIRD PART, WE SUGGESTED AN EASIER WAY TO ASPECT'S INTERPRETATION IN THE OF BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE, BASED IN THE TEXT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE ALSO MADE USE OF THE ASPECT AT THE ENGLIS

BRAZIL HAS A TECHNOLOGICAL DEFICIT REGARDING INNOVATION RACE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO MORE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES. THE TAX INCENTIVE FOR INNOVATION, INTRODUCED BY LEI DO BEM - LAW 11,196/05, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PUBLIC POLICIES CONCERNING R, D & I. WITH A RANGE OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT INCENTIVES TO DOMESTIC COMPANIES, INTENSIFIED AFTER 2004, THE TAX INCENTIVES AIM TO RELIEVE THE EXPENSES OF THE ORGANIZATIONS WITH R & D, ENCOURAGING INNOVATION FOR THE COUNTRY TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE BY INCREASING THE VALUE OF PRODUCTS DEVELOPED IN THEIR TERRITORY. THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION IS IN CHARGE FOR MONITORING THE INCENTIVE, HAVING THE BENEFITING COMPANIES THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ANNUALLY. THE MCTI PUBLISHES INFORMATION AS VALUES OF EXPENDITURES ON R&D AND THE VALUES OF TAX WAIVER GRANTED BY THE LAW, WHICH AMOUNTED TO 1.4 BILLION REAIS IN 2011 TO 767 BENEFICIARY COMPANIES. HOWEVER, NO INFORMATION ON IMPROVING THE INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS IS GIVEN. IN THIS SENSE, T

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT WORK IS THE ELABORATION OF A METHODOLOGY TO OFFER A COMPLETE VIEW OF THE EXTENSION, PRECISE PLACING, AND EXECUTION OF THE NOTES ON THE VIOLONCELLO FOR BEGINNERS. THE NOTES LOCALIZATION IS ACHIEVED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HARMONICS. THEY BECOME POINTS OF REFERENCE WHEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLEXIBLE INTONATION IS POINTED OUT, AND THE AURAL REFERENCE IS CONSIDERED A PRIORITY. IN THIS WAY, STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO FIND ALL THE HARMONICS UNTILL FIFTH ORDER WHILE MEMORIZING FOUR POINTS ON EACH STRING AS POSITIONS� REFERENCES. THESE ARE THE BUNTING POSITIONS. THEN, THE THREE LEFT HAND POSITIONS ARE PRESENTED SIMULTANEOUSLY, AS WELL AS THE THREE CLEFS, RELATED TO EACH OTHER, USED IN THE VIOLONCELLO REPERTOIRE.

MOST FOOD INDUSTRIES AND TEXTILE USE DYES FOR COLORING VARIOUS PRODUCTS, AND THEY CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT CAUSE SERIOUS POLLUTION PROBLEMS TO AQUATIC LIFE IN LAKES, RIVERS AND SEAS. THE TREATMENT OF THESE EFFLUENTS IS A GROWING CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE REAL IMPACT AND POTENTIAL TOXICITY PROBLEMS.

THE INDUSTRIALISATION AND URBAN LIFESTYLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTANT PRODUCTION OF WASTE AND FOR THE SYSTEMATIC USAGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THE CONTAMINATION OF EFFLUENTS FROM TEXTILE INDUSTRIES IS DUE MOSTLY TO THE USE OF DYES AND THE TREATMENT OF TEXTILE EFFLUENT AND IT IS NOT A TASK OF EASY RESOLUTION. MANY METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY LIMITATIONS, MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH TREATMENT COSTS AND THE HUGE VOLUMES OF RESIDUALS GENERATED. THE ADSORPTION IN WHICH ACTIVATED CARBONS ARE USED HAS SHOWN TO BE A METHOD WITH GOOD RESULTS IN COLOUR REMOVAL. IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF ACQUISITION AND REGENERATION OF ACTIVATED CARBON, VARIOUS MATERIALS HAVE BEEN TESTED AS LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE ADSORBENTS OR AS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THESE ADSORBENTS, LIKE THE CUPUA�U FRUIT PEEL WHICH IS A BYPRODUCT NORMALLY NOT UTILISED.

THE PROCESS OF COGNITION OF TRUTH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FROM TWO OPERATIONS INTELLECTUALS: THE SIMPLE APPREHENSION, AND THE COMPOSITION AND DIVISION. IN THE FIRST, THE THING IS MANIFESTED TO THE INTELLECT AND THIS IN ITS TURN APPREHENDS HIS BASICS. HOWEVER, THIS OPERATION IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE GOOD OUTCOME OF THE PROCESS OF TRUTH, ONCE THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT PRODUCES NOTHING OF HIMSELF. IT IS IN THE SECOND OPERATION THAT THE INTELLECT PRODUCES SOMETHING MYSELF: THE JUDGMENT, THE ABILITY TO JOIN OR SEPARATE SUBJECT OF PREDICATES. THIS INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE REFLECTION, THE CAPACITY OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT BACK TO HIMSELF.

NTPDASE2 IS AN ECTONUCLEOTIDASE ANCHORED IN THE PLASMA MEMBRANE THROUGH TWO TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAINS, WITH THE CATALYTIC SITE FACING THE EXTRACELLULAR ENVIRONMENT. ITS MAIN FUNCTION IS THE HYDROLYSIS OF NUCLEOTIDE TRIPHOSPHATES TURNING THEM INTO DIPHOSPHATE NUCLEOTIDES PLUS INORGANIC PHOSPHATE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, IT IS ALSO ABLE TO HYDROLYZE DIPHOSPHATE NUCLEOTIDES. AS ITS FUNCTION IS TO REMOVE THE EXTRACELLULAR ATP, ITS ABSENCE CAUSES THE ACCUMULATION OF NUCLEOTIDE.

THE ECHINOCOCCUS GRANULOSUS IS A PARASITE OF CLASS CESTODA, WHICH CAUSES CYSTIC HYDATID DISEASE. DURING ITS LIFE CYCLE IN THE INTERMEDIATE HOST (SHEEP OR CATTLE AND ACCIDENTALLY MAN), INITIATES THE FORMATION OF A HYDATID CYST, WHICH CONTAINS THE PRE-ADULT FORM OF THE PARASITE, THE PROTOESCOLEX (PSC). WHEN INGESTED BY A DEFINITIVE HOST (USUALLY THE DOMESTIC DOG), THE PSC WILL DEVELOP INTO THE ADULT WORM. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THE RUPTURE OF THE PRIMARY FERTILE CYST, RELEASING PSCS IN THE INTERMEDIATE HOST, WHICH MAY DEVELOP INTO SECONDARY HYDATID CYSTS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE ABOUT THE USE OF PROTEINS AS BIOMARKERS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE PLASTICITY OF E. GRANULOSUS. A POSSIBLE WAY TO STUDY THIS PROCESS IS TO ANALYZE THE PARASITE RESPONSE TO AN INDUCING EVENT, BY LABELING NEWLY SYNTHESIZED PROTEINS (NSP), USING RADIOACTIVE AMINO ACIDS OR, MORE RECENTLY, ARTIFICIAL AMINO ACIDS.

MANY PATHWAYS AND MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS ARE STILL POORLY DESCRIBED IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES. AMONG THESE PATHWAYS, THE KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO THE ACTION OF TOXIC COMPOUNDS DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. IN THIS SENSE, TWO SCENARIOS, OF BROAD CLINICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT STAND OUT: THE ABUSE OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL IN THE FORM OF FERMENTED OR DISTILLATES. IT IS KNOWN THAT THE CHEMICAL DERIVATIVES OF TOBACCO AND ETHANOL ARE CAPABLE OF ALTER THE FUNCTIONALITY OF DIFFERENT BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN BORN FROM SMOKING ABUSING WOMEN OR EXPOSED TO TOBACCO SMOKE SHOW INNUMEROUS MORPHOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS IN DIFFERENT TISSUES. IN ADDITION, THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES IN THE FETUS NEURAL TISSUE.

THE PATHOGENIC BACTERIA PROTEUS MIRABILIS PRODUCES UREASE AS VIRULENCE FACTOR. PROTEUS MIRABILIS IS A GRAM NEGATIVE OPPORTUNISTIC UROPATHOGEN, WHICH CAUSES SEVERE INFECTIONS IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. AMMONIA RELEASED FROM UREA HYDROLYSIS BY PROTEUS MIRABILIS UREASE (PMU) INCREASES THE LOCAL PH AND FORMS A MICROCLIMATE WHICH ALLOWS THE COLONIZATION OF THE HOST URINARY TRACT. PMU PRESENTS HIGH SIMILARITY TO OTHER UREASES, SUCH AS THAT FROM JACK BEAN SEEDS (JBU) OR FROM HELICOBACTER PYLORI (HPU), FOR WHICH OUR GROUP HAS DESCRIBED BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES UNRELATED TO UREA HYDROLYSIS. HERE WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER PMU SHARES WITH JBU AND HPU OTHER PROPERTIES UNRELATED TO ENZYME ACTIVITY.

"THIS WORK FOCUSED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE RHETORICAL AND TEXTUAL ORAL GENRES JUDICIARY: ""PROSECUTION"" AND ""DEFENSE"" IN THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE. IT INTENDS TO STUDY LINGUISTIC MECHANISMS THAT PEOPLE, PROSECUTORS AND ADVOCATES, USE IN DEFENSE OF THEIR ARGUMENTS. WE UNDERSTAND RHETORIC AS THE NEGOTIATION/PARLEY BETWEEN SUBJECTS WHO SHOW THEIR DIFFERENT OPINIONS OR DIFFERENCES WHEN THE CONTRADICTORY CONSTITUTES ITSELF AND THE ACT OF ARGUING EMERGES AS A MEANS TO CONVINCE AND PERSUADE OTHER THROUGH LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO GET THE ADHESION OF WHAT IS PRESENTED.

THE SOCIAL CONTEXT THAT PERMEATES THE ISSUE OF ADOLESCENTS IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW IS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGER. IN THIS SENSE THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE THE REASONS WHY THESE TEENAGERS COMMIT THE INFRACTIONS AND HOW THE COMPLIANCE OF THE FULFILLMENT SOCIOEDUCATIONAL HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN EFFECTIVE BREAK WITH THE WAY THAT CAUSED THE INFRACTION. TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THESE TEENAGERS AND REALIZE THEIR LIFE STORIES REVEALED THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL EXCLUSION, POVERTY AND ACT OF INFRACTION. THEREBY, THE RESEARCH PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, ADDRESSING HOW IT ESTABLISHES, IN OTHER WORDS, HOW THE POVERTY AND MARGINALIZATION CONTRIBUTES TO A TEENAGER WHO BECOMES A LAWBREAKER. FOR THIS IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE HOW POWER RELATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED AND CREATE SPACES FOR ONE OR THE OTHER, SEGREGATING AND STIGMATIZING.

THIS THESIS ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER LAWSUITS ON NATIONAL JUSTICE BY NGOS AND INDIVIDUALS CONTRIBUTE DO INCREASE POLITICAL SPACES IN DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. IN THE STUDY CASES OF PINOCHET, ELY OULD DAH AND FERRINI, WE EXAMINE DIFFERENT TRIAL COURSES RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND INITIATED, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COURTS FROM SPAIN, FRANCE AND ITALY. IN THESE THREE DISTINCT FORMS OF JUDICIALIZATION ARE PRESENTED LIMITED POLITICAL MEANS AND POSSIBLE LEGAL AID TO VICTIMS OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ON NATIONAL COURTS. THE FIRST TWO CASES FOCUS ON THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE (1984) AND OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION DEBATE IN SPANISH AND FRENCH COURTS. PROSECUTE AND JUDGE ACCUSED FOREIGNERS ALSO IMPLIES IDENTIFYING THE AUTHORSHIP OF SERIOUS CRIMES AS FOR INSTANCE TORTURE IN OTHER NATIONAL TERRITORIES THAN THOSE IN WHICH ITS OFFENCES WERE COMMITTED (SUCH AS PINOCHET IN CHILE AND ELY OULD DAH IN MAURITANIA).

IN PREVIOUS STUDIES DEVELOPED BY NIQFAR/UNIVALI, THE PROMISING ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF A. CATHARTICA EXTRACT WAS VERIFIED. THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP AND CHARACTERIZE NANO-EMULSIFIED SYSTEMS CONTAINING EXTRACT OF A. CATHARTICA, AND TO EVALUATE THE ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF THESE FORMULATIONS. THE SOFT EXTRACT OF THE FLOWERS WAS OBTAINED, CHARACTERIZED AND EVALUATED FOR ITS ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL. THE HPLC ANALYTICAL METHOD TO QUANTIFY OF PLUMIERIDE (PMD) IN THE A.

NANO-EMULSIFIED SYSTEMS (NES) WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PSEUDOTERNARY PHASE DIAGRAM, USING CAPRYLIC CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE (POLYMOL�) AS OILY PHASE AND A MIXTURE OF SORBITAN OLEATE (SPAN� 80) AND PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (ULTRAMONA� R400) AS SURFACTANT, BY THE METHOD OF PH
AMONG THE DISORDERS THAT AFFECT THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNC), PARKINSON�S DISEASE (DP) AND ALZHEIMER�S DISEASE (DA) HAVE REAL IMPORTANCE, DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH FREQUENCY IN THE POPULATION IN RECENT YEARS. IN BOTH CASES, THE PATHOLOGY IS NEURODEGENERATIVE, CHRONIC AND PROGRESSIVE. DP IS PRIMARILY CHARACTERIZED BY MOTOR DISORDERS AND NON-MOTOR DISTURBANCES (NEUROVEGETATIVE AND SENSORY CHANGES, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, MEMORY LOSS, AND DEPRESSION), WHILE DA, BESIDES SHARING SOME OF THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN DP, ALSO INVOLVES CHANGES IN COGNITIVE PROCESSES. BOTH DISEASES HAVE NO CURE, AND THE EXISTING DRUGS ARE PALLIATIVE, ONLY TREATING SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS, BUT WITHOUT ALTERING THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE. THERE IS AN ONGOING SEARCH FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL TARGETS IN THIS AREA, WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON MEDICINAL PLANTS. B.

INTRODUCTION: CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE WORLD, AND DUE TO THEIR HIGH BURDEN OF DISEASE AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT, REPRESENT A SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR MOST COUNTRIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF NUTRITION IN THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS IS RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE. HYPERTENSION AND DIABETES ARE PREVALENT, CHRONIC CONDITIONS, THE MAIN RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, AND THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY AND HOSPITALIZATION IN BRAZIL. OBJECTIVE: TO DESCRIBE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHY FOOD BY HYPERTENSIVE AND DIABETIC PEOPLE AND TO VERIFY THE ADEQUACY OF THEIR FOOD HABITS, ACCORDING TO THEIR CHRONIC CONDITION METHODS: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF DATA FROM THE BASELINE�S COHORT STUDY CONDUCTED IN 2011 WITH HYPERTENSIVE AND DIABETIC ADULTS CARED FOR IN A HEALTH SERVICE, DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN INTERVENTION ON THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

CANDIDA SPP. HAS BECOME IN RECENT DECADES, MAJOR CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF INVASIVE INFECTIONS, RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE SECRETED ASPARTATE PROTEASE (SAP) IS A FACTOR DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INFECTION EXERTING DECISIVE ROLE IN THE PATHOGENICITY OF CANDIDA SPP. AND THAT THE EXPOSURE TO SUBINIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS OF ANTIFUNGALS MAY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF SAP AND TO SELECT RESISTANT ISOLATES. WE ANALYZED ISOLATES OF CANDIDA ALBICANS AND CANDIDA NON-ALBICANS FROM CASES OF HOSPITAL INFECTION. WE EVALUATED THE PROTEIN PROFILE OF THE ISOLATES OF CANDIDA SPP. BY SDS-PAGE. WE EVALUATED ALSO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY PROFILE OF THE ISOLATES AGAINST ANTIFUNGALS OF USE CONVENTIONAL IN REGIMENS THERAPEUTICS (FLUCONAZOLE AND AMPHOTERICIN B) AND NEWER ANTIFUNGALS THAT ARE NOT YET PART OF THE HOSPITAL ROUTINE (VORICONAZOLE AND CASPOFUNGIN).

THE PRESENT WORK ANALYZES THE RELATION BETWEEN ADOLESCENCE, VIOLENCE, THE MEDIA AND CULTURE INDUSTRY, AND THE REPERCUSSIONS AND IMPACTS [OF THIS RELATION] ON BRAZILIAN SOCIETY. THE POINT AT ISSUE IS THE RELATION BETWEEN MASS MEDIA AND CRIME, I. E., ADVERTISEMENTS STIMULATING CONSUMERISM, AND THUS STIRRING UP THE GROWTH OF VIOLENCE, WHICH ESPECIALLY AFFECTS THE TEENAGERS IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIALIZATION. THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO INVESTIGATE IF THE MASS MEDIA MIGHT CONTRIBUTE THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS TO THE EXAGGERATED CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS AND GOODS THAT ARE SUPERFLUOUS, AND IF THE APPEAL OF CONSUMERIST PROPAGANDA MAY BE LINKED TO VIOLENCE, AS IT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF INFRACTIONS AMONG ADOLESCENTS. FOR A LONG TIME, THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND MOST OF THE CULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN TURNING WELL-BEING INTO MERCHANDISE, AND CULTURE INTO AN INDUSTRY WITH NO LIMITS ON THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.SPEAKING OF THE MEDIA AS AN INSTITUTED POWER, WE MAY NOT IGNORE THAT THIS POWER MAY DETERMINE OR DEFEND CERT

TUBERCULOSIS IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS. EVEN TODAY TUBERCULOSIS WORRIES HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, ESPECIALLY IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. THE STUDY OF THE GROWTH CURVE OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ALLOWS THE STUDY OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL TESTS WITH THIS BACILLUS IS VERY TIME CONSUMING, AND THEREFORE IT IS EXTREMELY USEFUL TO USE A MODEL WHICH FAITHFULLY REPRESENTS THE GROWTH CURVE OF M.

THE PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS A TRANSFORMATIONAL INITIATIVE IN MANAGING NATIONAL PUBLIC. THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION THROUGHOUT THE 1980S, ENDING IN THE FINAL DECADENT MILITARY REGIME (1964-1985), ALLOWED THE EMERGENCE OF A MORE AUTONOMOUS SOCIETY, ESTABLISHING NUMEROUS NEW CHANNELS OF PARTICIPATION WITH THE STATE. THUS, NUMEROUS INITIATIVES HAVE EMERGED MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXPAND THESE SPACES OF DIALOGUE WITH THE POPULATION, GIVING THE PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING (PB) AS A DEMOCRATIZING POLITICAL ELEMENT, AIMED AT MAKING THE GOVERNMENT AN ENTITY BETTER, MORE EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT, ESTABLISHING A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY, AND SEEKING TO OVERCOME THE ANCIENT AND ENTRENCHED CLIENTELISTIC PRACTICES.

THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF BUILDING INSPECTION LAWS IN BRAZIL IN GENERAL, WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON SPECIFIC LAWS FOR THE INSPECTION OF FA�ADE ELEMENTS. THE ROLE OF THESE LAWS AS RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN CIVIL CONSTRUCTION IS DISCUSSED, STRESSING DEVELOPMENTS, LIMITATIONS AND TRENDS OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. LOGICS AND THE THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATED ON THIS SUBJECT SUGGEST THAT THE ADOPTION OF A PROPER SYSTEM MAY ALLOW THE EARLY DETECTION OF PROBLEMS, WHICH CAN THEN BE CORRECTED BY PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ACTIONS, AND THEREFORE ARE LESS COSTLY AND POSE FEWER RISKS TO THE USERS. THIS IS A CRITICAL DEMAND IN MANY BRAZILIAN CITIES THAT HAVE MANY OLD BUILDINGS WITH CONSERVATION PROBLEMS. REPEATED ACCIDENTS, WHICH CULMINATED IN THE TRAGEDY IN RIO DE JANEIRO IN 2012, INSERTED THE ISSUING OF INSPECTION LAWS IN THE POLITICAL AGENDA OF MANY LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS AND OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

CLIENT REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT AIMS TO IMPROVE VALUE GENERATION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THIS REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS OF CAPTURING REQUIREMENTS, PROCESSING THIS INFORMATION, AND MAKING THEM EXPLICIT TO THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM, AS WELL AS CONTROLLING WHETHER THESE ARE PROPERLY BALANCED. THIS IS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT WHEN RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, SUCH AS IN LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES A LARGE AMOUNT OF QUALITATIVE INFORMATION, AND NEED TO CONSIDER THE DIVERSITY OF REQUIREMENTS THAT USUALLY EXIST AMONG DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROPOSE A METHOD TO MODEL CLIENT REQUIREMENTS IN LOW-INCOME HOUSING WITH THE SUPPORT OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM). THIS METHOD WAS DEVISED TO SUPPORT BOTH THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES DURING DESIGN STAGES, AND ALSO THE EVALUATION OF DESIGNS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FINISHED.

THEREFORE, THIS STUDY ANALYZED THE WISHES OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY AGAINST TERRORISM AND THE THIRST FOR AN EXACERBATED PUNITIVISM IN A CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL LAW EXPANSION, WHICH LEADS TO THE RELAXATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN EXCEPTIONAL REGIME. SUBSEQUENTLY, THIS THESIS PRESENTS A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE ENEMY CRIMINAL LAW THEORY � ITS CHARACTERISTICS, FOUNDATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL ASSUMPTIONS � AND THE CRIMINAL GARANTISM THEORY � WITH ITS FOCUS ON GREATER PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THIS STUDY FOCUS ON THE DEFINITIONS, CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSEQUENCES OF TERRORISM THAT TRIGGERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HARSH LAWS AGAINST TERRORISM AND ALSO THE PRACTICE OF TORTURE IN GUANTANAMO.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POROUS BIOMATERIALS IN BONE FORMATION AND REPAIR OF CERVICAL MANDIBULAR DEFECTS IN DOGS, WITH OR WITHOUT GUIDED BONE REGENERATION (GBR) TECHNIQUE. BIO-OSS BLOCK� (BB), BIO-OSS COLLAGEN� (BC), BIO-OSS� IN GRANULES (BG), AUTOGENOUS BONE (AB) AND COAGULUM (CG) WERE USED UNDER THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. FOR THE MEMBRANE GROUP, BIOGIDE� WAS USED. TWELVE DOGS UNDERWENT BILATERAL EXTRACTIONS OF MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS AND FIRST MOLARS. AFTER FOUR MONTHS FIVE BONE DEFECTS (6 MM LONG / 4 MM DEEP) WERE PREPARED AT ONE SIDE. IMPLANTS OF 3.3 X 10 MM WERE INSTALLED ON EACH OF MESIAL DEFECT, PROVIDING A DISTAL GAP OF 2.7 MM. THE DEFECTS WERE RANDOMLY FILLED WITH AB, CG, BB, BC AND BG. THE SAME PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED IN THE OPPOSITE SIDE AFTER EIGHT WEEKS. A MEMBRANE WAS USED TO COVER THE DEFECTS IN HALF OF THE SIDES. ANIMALS WERE SACRIFICED AFTER EIGHT WEEKS. IMPLANT STABILITY WAS MEASURED BY OSSTELL MENTOR�, AT IMPLANT INSTALLATION AND SACRIFICE. THE SPECIME
THE DROSOPHILIDAE FAMILY IS COMPOSED BY FLIES DISPLAYING DIFFERENT ALIMENTARY HABITS. THE MOST STUDIED SPECIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YEASTS THAT DEVELOP DURING DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT SUBSTRATES SUCH AS CACTI, FLOWERS AND FRUITS. HOWEVER, SOME SPECIES WITH MORE RESTRICT HABITS AS THE PREDATORY SPECIES IN THE SUBFAMILY STEGANINAE OR THE MYCOPHAGOUS SPECIES IN DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY LINEAGES IN THE FAMILY, ARE POORLY KNOWN. IN GENERA AS HIRTODROSOPHILA AND MYCODROSOPHILA THE INFORMATION ABOUT ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS IS SCARCE AND SPORADIC, PARTICULARLY IN THE NEOTROPICS, THIS SCARCITY LEAVES SOME APPEARANCE OF SEVERAL UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE SYSTEMATICS AND TAXONOMY FROM THE SPECIES OF THESE GENERA. CLARIFYING SOME OF THESE ISSUES MAY BE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE A PROGRESS IN FACE OF THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS THAT SEEMS TO ESTABLISH AND THE DESCRIPTION OF NEW SPECIES IS A NECESSARY STEP IN THIS WAY. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS DISSERTATION IS TO HELP IN THE RESOLUTION OF TAXONOMIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE NEOTROPICAL HIRTODRO

TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS (TES) ARE DNA FRAGMENTS THAT CAN MOVE WITHIN AND BETWEEN GENOMES CAUSING GREAT IMPACT ON THE EVOLUTION OF ORGANISMS. THE HAT SUPERFAMILY BELONGS TO CLASS II, SUBCLASS I OF TES AND DESPITE HAVING ORIGINALLY BEEN DESCRIBED IN INSECTS AND PLANTS, IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THESE ELEMENTS HAVE A WIDE DISTRIBUTION AND ARE DIVERSE IN MANY GROUPS OF HIGHER ORGANISMS. PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES SHOW THAT THIS SUPERFAMILY IS VERY ANCIENT AND ITS OCCURRENCE IN THESE GROUPS MAY BE RELATED TO EVENTS OF HORIZONTAL TRANSFER (HT). THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE POSSIBLE CASES OF HATS ELEMENTS' HT. THE ELEMENTS HOMO1 AND HOWILLI2 DESCRIBED BY ORTIZ AND LORETO IN 2009 IN D. WILLISTONI AND D. MOJAVENSIS SPECIES WERE SEARCHED IN NEOTROPICAL DROSOPHILA GENOMES USING PCR WITH DEGENERATE PRIMERS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR ELEMENTS AND DESCRIBED IN DISTANTLY RELATED SPECIES, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THESE ELEMENTS MIGHT BE BEING TRANSMITTED HORIZONTALLY.

THIS THESIS PROPOSES NEW APPROACHES FOR VARIABLE SELECTION AIMED AT FORMING REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS OF OBSERVATIONS. FOR THAT MATTER, WE SUGGEST A NEW VARIABLE IMPORTANCE INDEX BASED ON PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA), WHICH IS INTEGRATED TO A FORWARD PROCEDURE FOR VARIABLE SELECTION. THE QUALITY OF CLUSTERING PROCEDURE IS ASSESSED BY THE SILHOUETTE INDEX. A SIMULATION STUDY IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ON DIFFERENT LEVELS OF VARIABLE CORRELATION, NOISE AND NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS TO BE CLUSTERED. NEXT, WE MODIFY THE ORIGINAL METHOD BY REMAPPING OBSERVATIONS THROUGH KERNEL FUNCTIONS TAILORED TO IMPROVING THE CLUSTERING QUALITY AND REDUCING THE RETAINED VARIABLES. THE MODIFIED VERSION IS APPLIED TO 3 DATABASES RELATED TO CHEMICAL PROCESSES, INCREASING THE QUALITY OF CLUSTERING MEASURED BY SI ON AVERAGE 150%, WHILE USING AROUND 6% OF THE ORIGINAL VARIABLES.

BACKGROUND: HEART FAILURE (HF) IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF CARDIOVASCULAR HOSPITAL MORBIDITY IN BRAZIL. ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL SOCIETIES RECOMMEND MONITORING QUALITY OF CARE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, ITS ADHERENCE HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL AND LIMITED AND THEIR RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADEQUATELY STUDIED IN SEVERAL CONTEXTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS QUALITY OF CARE PARAMETERS IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH HF AND TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADHERENCE TO THESE MEASURES AND 30-DAY POSTDISCHARGE READMISSION RATES AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS IN BRAZILIAN PUBLIC HOSPITAL SETTING. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A HISTORIC COHORT STUDY USING SECONDARY DATA, WHICH INCLUDED 2070 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH HF IDENTIFIED BY CHARLSON COMORBIDITY INDEX (CCI) IN 2009 AND 2010. WE COLLECTED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND HOSPITAL OUTCOMES. QUALITY OF CARE WAS ASSESSED BY MEASURING BETA-BLOCKER, ACEI/ARB PRESCRIPTIONS AND APPROPRIATE MEDICAL INSTRUCTIONS AT DISCHARGE. RESULTS: THERE WAS, ON THE WHOLE SAMPLE, A HIGH MEDIAN CCI

THIS ELEMENT WAS IDENTIFIED IN SPECIES OF THE MAIN DROSOPHILA RADIATIONS, WHAT SUGGESTS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED EARLY IN THE DROSOPHILIDAE HISTORY (MARTIN ET AL., 1983). SEVERAL CASES OF HORIZONTAL TRANSFER HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED FOR COPIA: AMONG SPECIES OF THE SUBGROUP MELANOGASTER (JORDAN AND MCDONALD, 1998), D. MELANOGASTER AND D.

TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS ARE GENOMIC PARASITES THAT CAUSE A DEEP IMPACT IN THE GENOMES THEY INHABIT. THESE ELEMENTS EXPLOIT THE HOST MOLECULAR MACHINERY FOR THEIR OWN REPLICA-TION. MOREOVER, DUE TO THEIR REPLICATIVE MECHANISM THEY INCREASES ITS COPY NUMBER INSIDE OF THE HOST GENOME. THEIR MOBILITY AND CONSEQUENT INCREASE IN COPY NUMBER COULD GE-NERATE A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE HOST GENOME AS INACTIVATION OF HOST GENES AND MASSIVE REARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE CONSEQUENT INCREASE OF THE HOST GENOMES DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF THESE PARASITES ALSO CAN BE SEEM AS AN INCREASE IN VARIABILITY, THAT IS, AN INCREASE OF GENETIC MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR THE NATURAL SELECTION OPERATE AT THE LEVEL OF THE HOST. AS A RESULT THESE ELEMENTS USUALLY ARE UNDER STRONG SELECTION PRESSURE THAT COULD ELIMINATE OR EVEN FIX THEM IN THE POPULATION. ONE ROUTE THAT IS USED BY TES TO SCAPE THEIR ELIMINATION BY NATURAL SELECTION IS THE HORIZONTAL TRANSPOSON TRANSFER (HTT), THE TRANSFER OF GENETIC MATERIAL BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATED SPECIES. DUE

THIS CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTE OPENS A PROLIFIC WAY FOR THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ROLE OF COURT OF AUDITORS, NOT ONLY AS AN AUXILIARY ORGAN OF LEGISLATIVE POWER, BUT ALSO AS AN ORGAN WHICH DEFENDS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRACY ITSELF. THEN, THIS WORK IS AN INVESTIGATIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH WHICH PRINCIPAL AIM IS TO ANALYZE IF THE BRAZILIAN COURT OF AUDITORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, AFTER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1988, ALSO AN INSTRUMENT OFVERTICAL ACCOUNTABILITY, ALTHOU

HYPERTENSION IS A CHRONIC DISEASE OF GREAT MAGNITUDE IN BRAZIL. THE BENEFIT OF REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE LEVELS AND THE EFFICACY OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED, BUT THE CONTROL RATE OF HYPERTENSION IS FAR FROM DESIRABLE. LOW COMPLIANCE SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN REASON. HOWEVER, CARE OF CHRONIC DISEASES CANNOT BE ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY BY HEALTH SYSTEMS TOWARD ACUTE ILLNESS AND ORGANIZED SO FRAGMENTED. IN THIS STUDY ACCESS TO AND USE OF SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION ARE FOCUSED AS ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS IN CONTROLLING HYPERTENSION. A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 300 PARTICIPANTS. THE RATE OF PATIENTS WITH CONTROLLED HYPERTENSION WAS 52.7% ( 95% CI 49.8 TO 55.6). HOWEVER, THE 265 PATIENTS WHO REPORTED A SERVICE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE HAD BETTER CONTROL RATE OF HYPERTENSION (55.8% VERSUS 31.4%, P = 0.007).

WORK RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (WRMD) AFFECT THE HEALTH OF WORKERS, SINCE THE NINETIES, GENERATING OCCURRENCES IN A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, IN DIFFEREN�T COUNTRIES AND SEVERAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE BEING ONE OF EXPRESSED CASES IN THE OCCUPATIONAL CONTEXT. EMPLOYEES SUBJECTED TO SIMILAR LOADS, PERFORMING THE SAME ACTIVITY, CAN PRESENT SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS OF THEIR STATE OF HEALTH WORK RELATED. AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WRMD CASES IS THE PREVENTION, ONLY BECOMES EFFECTIVE IF IT IS PARTICIPATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE AND IF IT MINIMIZES THE RISK FACTORS PRESENT AT THE WORKPLACE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CONDUCT THE PREVENTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO WRMD, THROUGH A STRUCTURAL ERGONOMIC APPROACH, INTERPRETATION, PREVALENCES, TYPES OF TREATMENTS OR REHABILITATION TO RETURN TO WORK, AS WELL AS GENERATING CONTROLS DEVICES OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO WRMD IN A CEMENT INDUSTRY, BASED ON SOBANE STRATEGY, TO BE A PREVENTION STRATEGY WHICH EVALUATES THE RISK FACTORS AND ALLOWS THE IN
THIS PAPER AIMS TO APPLY A METHODOLOGY THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF SUSTAINABILITY IN URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOR THAT IT WAS DEVELOPED THE ANALYZES OF SOME PAPERS OF THE THREE MOVEMENTS THAT ARE KNOWN AS: ECOBAIRRO/BRAZIL PROGRAMM, GAIA EDE - ECOVILLAGE DESIGN EDUCATION AND TRANSITION TOWNS MOVEMENT, AND WE FOUND GREAT SIMILARITIES. WE ALSO HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES DURING SOCIAL RESIDENCY AND WHEN DEVELOPING AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH, ALSO KNOWN AS RESEARCH IN ACTION ACTION AT AN SPECIFIC CONTEXT - A STREET LOCATED AT �CALABAR COMMUNITY� - SALVADOR - BAHIA .DURING A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS IT WAS REALISED WORKSHOPS, LECTURES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH THE RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY . IT WAS FOUND THAT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES IN CONDUCTING SUCH ACTIVITIES, SOME PRACTICES HAD BEEN INCORPORATED SUCH AS THE RECYCLING OF PET BOTTLES , WHICH CONTRIBUTION WAS TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF WASTE AND AS CONSEQUENCE THE STREET WAS CLEANER. ANOTHER RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ECOBAIRRO HORNB
"THE RECOGNITION OF PATTERNS IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND THE ELUCIDATION OF THE PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIATION IN SPECIES RICHNESS AMONG HABITATS THAT PRODUCE THESE PATTERNS ARE CLASSICAL GOALS OF COMMUNITY ECOLOGY. THE NESTEDNESS PATTERN OF SPECIES OCCURRENCE ON ISLANDS WAS INITIALLY POSTULATED AS RESULTING FROM SELECTIVE EXTINCTION - SPECIES-POOR SITES ARE SUBSETS OF SPECIES-RICH SITES. ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS THAT CAN GENERATE THIS PATTERN INCLUDE PASSIVE SAMPLING, SELECTIVE EXTINCTION, SELECTIVE COLONIZATION AND HABITAT NESTEDNESS. THE CONCEPT, MEASURES AND ANALYSIS STRATEGIES OF NESTEDNESS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN CHALLENGED BY STUDIES DEMONSTRATING THE INCONSISTENCY OF APPROACHES TRADITIONALLY USED, SO THE ISSUE REMAINS OPEN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE NESTEDNESS OF WATERBIRDS ASSEMBLAGES IN FRAGMENTS OF WETLANDS AND THEIR MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE. SPECIFICALLY, THE FOLLOWING EXPECTATIONS WERE TESTED: (1) THE NESTEDNESS PATTERN IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NESTEDNESS HABITAT, RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE FRAGMENTS
THIS DISSERTATION EVALUATED THE AGE-SEX STRUCTURE, GROUP SIZE AND POPULATION DENSITY OF ALOUATTA GUARIBA CLAMITANS IN 40 FOREST FRAGMENTS. WE ALSO PRESENT A POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS FOR THE SUBSPECIES. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT CAMPO DE INSTRU��O DE SANTA MARIA (CISM), AN AREA OF 5,876 HA BELONGING TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (BRAZILIAN ARMY) AND SURROUNDING AREAS, LOCATED IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF SANTA MARIA (RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, SOUTH BRAZIL). THE FIELDWORK WAS CONDUCTED FROM MARCH 2012 TO FEBRUARY 2013, TOTALING 58 DAYS AND SAMPLING EFFORT OF 431 HOURS. OUR DATA SUGGEST HIGH MORTALITY IN THE BROWN HOWLER MONKEY POPULATIONS AT CISM. THE RECORD OF LOW DENSITIES, LOW OCCUPANCY RATES IN FRAGMENTS AND SMALL GROUP SIZE SUPPORTS OUR CONCLUSIONS. STATISTICAL ANALYZES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CURRENT POPULATION PARAMETERS AND THE PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED. THE PVA RESULTS SUGGEST THE FRAGMENT SIZE AND ADULT FEMALE SURVIVAL AS THE BEST PARAMETERS CONTRIBUTING FOR THE POPULATION GROWTH. YELLOW FE

THIS DISSERTATION DEALS WITH THE REFLECTIONS IN THE TAX AREA, THE APPLICABILITY IN BRAZILIAN LAW OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES. SUCH APPLICABILITY STEMS FROM THE OPENING OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM, BY CONSTITUTION OF 1988, THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, ENABLING THE INCORPORATION OF THOSE TREATIES INTO DOMESTIC LAW, AS NORMATIVE SOURCE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THOSE RIGHTS. AS REGARDS THE LEGAL IMPACT OF SUCH TREATIES IN DOMESTIC LAW, PRESENTS TO THE SITUATIONS OF NORMATIVE CONFLICT, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIALOGICAL METHOD OF SOLUTION OF ANTINOMIES, GUIDED BY HERMENEUTICAL PRINCIPLE INTERNATIONAL PRO HOMINE. AND BECAUSE OF THE HIERARCHICAL SUPERIORITY ATTRIBUTED TO INTERNATIONAL TREATIES OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY APPEAR AS VERTICAL LIMITS TO PRODUCTION MATERIALS NORMATIVE STATE, AND POSSIBLE CONTROL OF CONVENTIONALITY OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION IN THE FACE OF SUCH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

THE ROLE OF RICE FIELDS IN REPRESENTING ALTERNATIVEREFUGEES FOR WETLAND-EXPELLED MACROINVERTEBRATES, IN VARIOUS SCALES, WAS ASSESSEDIN SOUTHERN BRAZIL. IT IS EXPECTED THAT RICE FIELDS SUSTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE VERSION, ALTHOUGH POORER, OF WETLAND�S MACROINVERTEBRATE FAUNA. SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS FROM THE CENTRAL DEPRESSION IN THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, AWAY HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS FROMEACH OTHER. WETLANDS AND RICE FIELDS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY SAMPLED. RICHNESS WAS FOUND TO BE EQUIVALENT IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS. MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES� COMPOSITION AND TAXONOMIC STRUCTURE WERE DIFFERENT AT BOTH ENVIRONMENTS. IN RICE FIELDS, ACTIVE DISPERSAL TAXAWERE MORE COMMON, SUGGESTING THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF A DRY-PHASE AT GROWTH AREAS DURING INTERCROP SEASON FAVORS COLONIZATION BY THESE TAXA. IN WETLANDS, REGIONAL SCALE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY.

ADVANCED ACCESS (AA) IS A MODERN SYSTEM OF APPOINTMENTS AND SCHEDULLINGS ON MEDICAL VIS-ITS, WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE HIS OWN DOCTOR ON THE SAME DAY THEY WANT OR UNTIL 48 HOURS FROM THE REQUESTED VISIT. MANY NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEMS, LIKE CANADA AND ENGLAND, FOR EXEMPLE, IMPLEMMENTED THE ADVANCED ACCESS ON PRIMARY HEALTH CARE TO ENHANCE BETTER ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. THE ADVANCED ACCESS AIMS TO REDUCE THE TIME OF WAITING LISTS FOR MEDICAL CARE, DECREASE THE NO-SHOW RATES AND CAN ENHANCE NUMBER OF MEDICAL VISITS. ON BRAZIL, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ORGANIZES THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE BY THE FAMILY HEALTH TEAM, WHICH IS COMPOSED BY ONE GENERAL PRACTITIONER, ONE NURSE PRACTITIONER, TWO TO THREE NURSING TECHNICIANS AND FOUR TO SIX COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. FLORIAN�POLIS, STATE CAPITAL OF SANTA CATARINA, BRAZIL, HAS ONE OF THE MOST COVERAGES OF FAMILY HEALTH TEM WORKERS ON BRAZIL, AND A PLENTY OF FAMILY HEALTH TEAM HAS ADOTED THE ADVANCED ACESS ON THIS CITY.

HEREIN WE PRESENT A FOUR CHAPTER STUDY ON THE ECOLOGY OF A SNAKE ASSEMBLAGE FROM THE BRAZILIAN SEMI-ARID. THE FIRST CHAPTER IS THE COMPARISON OF THE EFFICIENCY OF FOUR TRADITIONAL METHODS USED TO SAMPLE SNAKES: TIME-CONSTRAINED SEARCH, OCCASIONAL ENCOUNTERS BY THE STAFF, OCCASIONAL ENCOUNTERS BY THIRDS AND PITFALL TRAPS WITH DRIFT-FENCES. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CONCOMITANT USE OF THESE METHODS IS EFFECTIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY TO DETERMINE THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AREA, BUT IF THE OBJECTIVES ARE RELATED TO SPECIES ABUNDANCE OR ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE THE METHODS MAY BE OVERLAID AND THE USE OF THESE METHODS TOGETHER SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS. IN THE SECOND CHAPTER WE PRESENT A SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTIVE AUTOECOLOGY OF THE 22 SPECIES OF SNAKES FOUND IN THE STUDY AREA. DURING THIS STUDY MOST INDIVIDUALS WERE REPRESENTED BY OXYBELIS AENEUSAND PHILODRYAS NATTERERI. THE THIRD CHAPTER DEALS WITH THE EFFECTS OF INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE ASSEMBLAGE. IN THIS CHAPTER WE INDICATE, THROUGH A NULL MODEL APPROACH, T
THIS DISSERTATION PRESENTS INFORMATION ON (1) THE LIST OF BUTTERFLY SPECIES IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, AND ON (2) THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF BUTTERFLIES ASSEMBLAGES. THE STUDY WAS EXECUTED IN FOUR ATLANTIC FOREST FRAGMENTS, TWO IN SEASONAL DECIDUOUS FOREST AND TWO IN OMBROPHILOUS MIXED FOREST. FROM SEPTEMBER 2011 TO AUGUST 2012, AFTER 432 SAMPLING/NET/HOURS, 3984 INDIVIDUALS WERE RECORDED BELONGING TO 165 BUTTERFLY SPECIES OF THE PAPILIONIDAE, PIERIDAE, LYCAENIDAE, RIODINIDAE AND NYMPHALIDAE FAMILIES. NYMPHALIDAE (50.3%) WAS THE FAMILY WITH THE GREATER RICHNESS REPRESENTATIVENESS, FOLLOWED BY LYCAENIDAE (19.6%), PIERIDAE (11.7%), RIODINIDAE (11%), AND PAPILIONIDAE (7.4%). THE LIST OF SPECIES CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE OF 37 NEW RECORDS OF BUTTERFLIES FOR THE CENTRAL REGION OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, AND FIVE OF THESE CONSTITUTE NEW RECORDS FOR THE STATE.

THE MACRO AND MICROHABITAT USE BY SMALL-MAMMAL WAS INVESTIGATED IN AN ATLANTIC FOREST-PAMPA MOSAIC. A GRID WITH 88 TRAPS WAS USED, BEING 27 INSTALLED IN THE UNDERSTORY E VERY TWO TRAPS PLACED ON THE GROUND, WHICH WERE 70 M APART OF EACH OTHER. THE FIELDWORK WAS CARRIED OUT IN 17 MONTHLY PHASES, DURING FIVE DAYS, FROM JUNE 2011 TO OCTOBER 2012, TOTALIZING A SAMPLING EFFORT OF 7480 TRAP-NIGHTS. AN ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO VERIFY DIFFERENCES IN RICHNESS, TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND ABUNDANCE OF EACH SPECIES AMONG GRASSLAND, EDGES AND FOREST. THE SAME ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO TEST IF THE BODY MASS OF EACH SPECIES DIFFERS BETWEEN THE VEGETATION TYPES. ELEVEN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES MEASURED WERE SUMMARIZED THROUGH A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA). SUBSEQUENTLY, A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BETWEEN RICHNESS AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF EACH SPECIES AND THE FIRST TWO AXES OF PCA. THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE ALSO CORRELATED TO THE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMAL THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF REDUNDANCY

"INTRODUCTION: THE USE OF PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A RELEVANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM NOT ONLY IN BRAZIL BUT ALSO WORLDWIDE, AS WELL AS ITS SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND INDIVIDUAL COSTS. RECOGNITION AND TRACKING OF USERS REQUIRE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS TRAINED WITH TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFECTIVE RESULTS. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS), WHO REPRESENT A GATEWAY FOR HEALTH SYSTEM USERS, AND WHO REPRESENT THE TEAM'S LINK WITH THE COMMUNITY CAN OFFER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND LONGITUDINAL PERFORMANCE. IN SUCH A CONTEXT, THIS RESEARCH AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE CHW' KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CRACK AND OTHER DRUGS AND TO DESCRIBE THEIR HEALTH AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE. METHODOLOGY: THIS IS A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY, PERFORMED FROM MAY TO DECEMBER 2012
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BRAZILIAN UNIFIED HEALTH SYSTEM, INCLUDING EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE WITH COMPREHENSIVENESS AND EQUITY, REQUIRE PERMANENT EVALUATION. IN SUCH CONTEXT, USER�S EVALUATION IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSURE QUALITY OF CARE AND ALIGNMENT OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM WITH POPULATION�S EXPECTATION. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE CONTEXTUAL AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF HEALTH SYSTEM USERS, AS PART OF THE STUDY CARRIED OUT BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OMBUDSMAN. THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY EVALUATED 18673 NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM USERS, AGED 16 YEARS OR MORE, IN 62 BRAZILIAN MUNICIPALITIES. INDIVIDUAL DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, FOLLOWING A RANDOM SAMPLING. CONTEXTUAL DATA INCLUDED DEMOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE CHARACTERISTICS, PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN SOCIAL POLICIES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT, CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, FAMILY HEALTH COVERAGE, AND HEALTH RESULTS OF THE MUNICIPALITIES.

FROM A HISTORICAL SERIES OF ROCKET LAUNCHES OBTAINED WORLDWIDE, THIS THESIS PROPOSES A SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION FOR THE DIVERSE FAMILIES OF SPACE CRAFTS AND AEROSPACE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO ARRANGE THESE FAMILIES OF LAUNCHERS WITHIN THE VARIOUS PROJECTS OF AN AEROSPACE PROGRAM AIMING AT THE DEFINITION OF A PROJECT LAUNCHER VEHICLE IN EACH GENERATED CATEGORY TO ENABLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OR EXPANSION OF AEROSPACE INFRASTRUCTURE IN A GIVEN COUNTRY. THE PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION WAS OBTAINED BY USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE AGGLOMERATIVE HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING. THE CHOSEN METHOD WAS PROVED TO BE EFFICIENT AT GENERATING HOMOGENEOUS GROUPS AND IT WAS ABLE TO CLASSIFY THE ROCKETS IN FIVE CATEGORIES. EACH CATEGORY WAS DEFINED BY RANGES OF VARIATION OF CHOSEN PARAMETERS THAT ENABLED THE PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF LAUNCHING CENTERS THAT WAS ALSO PRESENTED IN FIVE CATEGORIES.

THE BRAZILIAN LAYING POULTRY, SINCE THE YEAR 2000 HAS FACED SOME CHANGES IN ITS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. THE OPENING OF MARKETS IN THE 1990S BROUGHT MODERNIZATION AND INNOVATION TO THE EGG PRODUCTION SECTOR, BUT ALSO PLACED THE EGG PRODUCER IN AN INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE MARKET TO BUY GRAINS, MAINLY CORN, TACKLING HIGH PRICES AND VOLATILITY. THE STABILITY IN THE DEMAND, COMBINED WITH HIGH COSTS AND THE RISE OF PRODUCTIVE COMPANY CAPACITY CREATED THIS ECONOMIC ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF RIVALRY FOR MARKET SHARE AMONG COMPANIES, MEANLY ON REGIONS WHERE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF COMPANIES AND THE LARGEST PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION INDEXES ARE: THE SOUTHEAST.

NOWADAYS, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEMANDS OF THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET, THERE IS NO SPACE FOR THE PASSAGE OF PIPES UNDER THE BEAMS THAT SUPPORT THE CONCRETE SLABS. THEN, AN INCREASINGLY COMMON SOLUTION IS THE INTRODUCTION OF HOLES IN THE BEAM WEB FOR THE PASSAGE OF PIPES AND DUCTS. THESE OPENINGS CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF INTERNAL STRESSES AND CREATE A POSSIBILITY OF CONCRETE CRACKING OR CRUSHING. THE DESIGNS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS HAVE BEEN BASED ON EMPIRIC METHODS FOR OVER FOUR DECADES. HOWEVER, ON PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS NEW FACTORS APPEAR AND MUST BE CONSIDERED SUCH AS HIGHER COMPRESSION STRESSES, THE POSSIBILITY OF INVERSION OF THE BENDING MOMENT DIAGRAM DUE TO THE INITIAL PRESTRESS OF THE BEAM, TRANSPORTATION AND HIGHER LOADINGS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO PERFORM A NON-LINEAR ANALYSIS OF PRESTRESSED BEAMS WITH OPENINGS IN THE WEB USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD TO EVALUATE ITS STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOR.

HOWEVER, THE HUMAN BEING IS IN CONSTANT SEARCH FOR BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS, THUS HE EXPLORES AND TRANSFORMS THE MATERIALS FOUND IN NATURE, AIMING ACHIEVEMENTS USING SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION (S&T&I). MANY SPECIES OF PALMS FOUND IN THE AMAZON REGION AND ESPECIALLY IN ACRE ARE SOURCES OF VEGETABLE OILS, WHICH ATTRACT THE INTEREST OF RESEARCHERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS, E.G. UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS, CAROTENOIDS AND ANTIOXIDANTS. SUCH FEATURES ARE FOUND IN THE FRUIT AND OIL OF BURITI (MAURITIA FLEXUOSA L. F.), SPECIE CHOSEN AS A SOURCE OF STUDY FOR THIS WORK WHICH IS RICH IN MICRONUTRIENTS WITH ANTIOXIDANT, MOISTURIZER AND SUNSCREEN PROPERTIES, HIGHLIGHTING THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BETA-CAROTENE, A PRECURSOR OF VITAMIN A. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK CONSISTED IN OBTAINING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BURITI OIL, BY PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS, ENAB
"THE BROMELIACEAES CONSIST OF A COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL SUBSYSTEM WHICH HELPS TO MAINTAINTHE STABILITY OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. ITS USE FOR ORNAMENTAL PURPOSES AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE DEFORESTATION OF TROPICAL FORESTS CAUSE A REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY, WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MORPHOLOGICAL RESPONSES IN VITRO MULTIPLICATION OF AECHMEA SETIGERA MART. EX SCHULT. & SCHULT. F. SHOOTS UNDER THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CYTOKININS
THE INTEREST TO STUDY CERTAIN SPECIES OF PALMS COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PRODUCTIVE AND ABUNDANT AND ARE PRESENT IN THE DIETARY OF TRADITIONAL PEOPLE. THE ASTROCARYUM ACULEATUM MEYER, POPULARLY KNOWN AS TUCUMANZEIRO, IS AMONG THE PALM TREES THAT ARE SHOWING PROGRESS IN R & D & I. AIMING TO CONTRIBUTE AND BROADEN THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE OIL PROPER TIES OF THIS SPECIES AND PREDICT POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS, IT WAS PROPOSED THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL AND SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE OIL PULP FROM THE ASTROCARYUM ACULEATUM MEYER. FRUITS OF TUCUM� WERE COLLECTED ON A RURAL PROPERTY LOCATED ALONG THE BR 317, IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF CAPIXABA - AC. THE PULP WAS SUBJECTED TO OVEN DRYING AND THE DRIED MATERIAL WAS CRUSHED AND SUBJECTED TO HOT SOLVENT EXTRACTION. THE OIL OBTAINED WAS ANALYZED FOR THE LEVELS OF ACIDITY, PEROXIDE, IODINE, SAPONIFICATION, DENSITY, REFRACTION AND VISCOSITY AND BY USING SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS LIKE ULTRAVIOLET VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY, INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, LUMINESCENCE, THERMAL LENS, X-

THE COMPUTER PROCESSING POWER OF COMPUTERS HAS EVOLVED CONSIDERABLY IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT STILL REQUIRE MANY MACHINES TO PERFORM A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROCESSING IN PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED WAY. GRID TECHNOLOGIES ARE EMERGING AS THE NEXT GENERATION OF DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING, ALLOWING THE AGGREGATION OF RESOURCES THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE RESOURCES ARE INDEPENDENT AND MANAGED SEPARATELY BY VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE TASKS SCHEDULING IN A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM PRESENT MANY ALGORITHMS.

NANOTECHNOLOGY IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY SET OF TECHNIQUES THAT MANIPULATES MATERIAL AT NANOSCALE, PRECISELY PARTICLES BELOW 100 NANOMETERS WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS, DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE, ARE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FOUND IN MATERIAL WHILE IN MACRO FORMAT. IN THE LIGHT OF THESE NEW PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS, THERE ARE KNOWLEDGE GAPS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF THESE PARTICLES ON THE HUMAN BODY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH STILL CONSIDERED EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, THEIR GROWTH IS INCREASINGLY ACCELERATED AND THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT USE NANOTECHNOLOGY IN SOME STAGE OF ITS PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO GROW, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS INVOLVED WITH THE TOPIC. GIVEN THIS SCENARIO AND ITS RELEVANT LITERATURE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A PROPOSED METHODOLOGY OF ACTIONS IN OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH) TO RESEARCH LABORATORIES WITH NANOTECHNOLOGY ACTIVITIES.

"""THIS DISSERTATION AIMS TO IDENTIFY ASPECTS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT IN MODELING PEDESTRIANS. THE MODELING OF PEDESTRIAN BEHAVIOR BEGINS BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS, UNDERSTANDING HOW PEOPLE MOVE, MAKE ROUTE CHOICE, INTERACT WITH OTHER PEDESTRIANS, VEHICLES, OBSTACLES, ETC. SIMULATION MODELS OF PEDESTRIANS ARE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WAY THEY MOVE QUITE REALISTICALLY, HOWEVER, THE COMBINED SIMULATION OF PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES STILL PRESENTING SOME POOR ASPECTS DUE TO THE WIDE DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELING APPROACH OF THE TWO MODES. THE PEDESTRIAN ROAD CROSSING REPRESENTATION IN THE TRADITIONAL SIMULATION MODELS HAS LIMITATIONS THAT MAY IMPACT ON THE RESULTS GENERATED BY THE SIMULATORS. THIS DISSERTATION LISTS SEVERAL BEHAVIORS ARISING FROM THE INTERACTION OF PEDESTRIANS WITH VEHICLES AT ROAD CROSSING SITUATIONS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NOT PRESENT IN THE SIMULATORS.

IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS BECOMES CRUCIAL TO DESIGN AND SIMULATE THEIR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN ADVANCE. ACCORDINGLY, GETTING MORE ASSERTIVE AND CONSISTENT DATA ABOUT THE REALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SITE CAN BRING BENEFITS TO MANAGEMENT. THE DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION HAS BEEN USED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY IN CONSTRUCTION, AND HELPING THE DECISION MAKING. HOWEVER, THE USE OF SIMULATION TENDS TO BE LITTLE EXPLORED DURING THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM, MAINLY DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN INTERPRETING THE DATA AND LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF THE DECISION MAKERS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TOOL. THEREFORE, EXIST E NEED OF IMPROVEMENT OF THE OUTPUT OF THE SIMULATION THROUGH THE USE OF VISUAL AND SPATIAL TOOLS.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO POINT OUT AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE SIMULTANEOUS FAMILIES� PHENOMENON IN CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN LAW. THE FAMILY, ONCE A SPECIFIC FORM OF HUMAN AGGREGATION WHICH ASSURES THE SURVIVAL OF ITS MEMBERS, CHANGED THROUGHOUT LIFE CYCLES, CULTURAL CONTEXTS AND INTERPERSONAL CONFLICTS AND IT HAS STILL GONE THROUGH TRANSFORMATIONS THAT CORRESPONDED TO CHANGES IN THE SOCIETY. FAMILY THUS FIGURES AS A CHANGEABLE ENTITY, SINCE IT HAS BEEN MODIFYING AND ORGANIZING ITSELF, AND THAT�S WHY IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY FAMILY AS AN UNIQUE OR IDEAL MODEL. IN THE CLASSICAL SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY THE BRAZILIAN CIVIL CODIFICATION OF 1916, THE FAMILIAR MODEL WAS DESIGNED FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF FAMILY, WITH A PATRIARCHAL AND HIERARCHICAL CHARACTER. THUS, THE PROTECTION OF THE FAMILIAR ENTITY WAS SOLELY CENTERED ON THE MATRIMONY.

THIS PIECE OF WORK EXAMINES THREE ASSET PRICING MODELS TO IDENTIFY WHICH MODEL BEST EXPLAINS THE STOCK RETURNS OF THE BRAZILIAN MARKET TO CALCULATE THE COST OF CAPITAL OF THE BRAZILIAN PORTS MARKET. THE CAPM (CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL) AND THE MULTIFACTOR MODELS WITH THREE FACTORS OF FAMA AND FRENCH ARE TESTED. THE CAPM USES A SINGLE VARIABLE, THE MARKET FACTOR IN EXPLAINING THE RETURN ON ASSETS. JUDGING INSUFFICIENT MARKET FACTOR, TWO RELATED TO STOCK MARKET FACTORS ARE ADDED, THE SIZE FACTOR AND THE VALUE FACTOR, FORMING THE THREE-FACTOR MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MULTIFACTOR MODELS FEATURE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EXPLANATORY POWER OF THE CAPM RETURNS. IT WAS ADOPTED THE AVERAGE OF THE CAPM AND FAMA-FRENCH FOR THE CALCULATION OF EQUITY. THE COST OF DEBT WAS CALCULATED THE MODEL WAS SUGGESTED BY THE METHODOLOGY CAPM, AND FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE WACC (WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL) WAS USED THREE PRICING METHODOLOGIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

A PROBLEM�TICA DA GERA��O DE RES�DUOS INDUSTRIAIS VEM SE AGRAVANDO, PRINCIPALMENTE PELO FATO DE QUE SOMENTE UMA PEQUENA PARCELA DESSES RES�DUOS � CORRETAMENTE TRATADA E DEVIDAMENTE DESTINADA EM LOCAIS PR�PRIOS. UM EXEMPLO DE RES�DUO COM GRANDE POTENCIAL POLUIDOR � A MANIPUEIRA, EFLUENTE L�QUIDO GERADO EM GRANDES QUANTIDADES NO PROCESSAMENTO DE MANDIOCA PARA A PRODU��O DE FARINHA E DE F�CULA. A MANIPUEIRA CONT�M UMA ELEVADA CARGA ORG�NICA NA SUA COMPOSI��O, COM ALTO TEOR DE F�CULA RESIDUAL, RESULTANTE DO BAIXO RENDIMENTO DO PROCESSO DE EXTRA��O. OUTRO GRANDE PROBLEMA AMBIENTAL � A PERDA DE NUTRIENTES APLICADOS NO SOLO POR MEIO DE FERTILIZANTES, PRINCIPALMENTE DO NITROG�NIO, DECORRENTE DOS PROCESSOS DE LIXIVIA��O PELA �GUA DAS CHUVAS E VOLATILIZA��O PELO AQUECIMENTO DO SOLO, QUE TRAZEM PREJU�ZOS FINANCEIROS AOS AGRICULTORES E DANOS AMBIENTAIS PELO EXCESSO DE NUTRIENTES LEVADOS AOS CORPOS H�DRICOS.

O ESTUDO PARA O EMPREGO DE BIOFILMES NA SUBSTITUI��O DO PL�STICO CONVENCIONAL DESTINADO A ALGUMAS APLICA��ES ESPEC�FICAS VEM GANHANDO FOR�A E RECEBENDO CONSIDER�VEL ATEN��O NO CEN�RIO DOS RECURSOS RENOV�VEIS. DENTRE AS IN�MERAS APLICA��ES DOS BIOFILMES PODE-SE CITAR O SEU USO NO REVESTIMENTO DE FERTILIZANTES DE LIBERA��O LENTA. NORMALMENTE, GRANDE PARTE DO NITROG�NIO APLICADO SOB A FORMA DE FERTILIZANTE NO SOLO, � PERDIDO DEVIDO AOS PROCESSOS AOS QUAIS ESTE EST� SUJEITO, A LIXIVIA��O PELA �GUA DA CHUVA E VOLATILIZA��O PELO CALOR. ESSAS PERDAS, AL�M DE CAUSAR PREJU�ZOS AOS AGRICULTORES, CAUSAM TAMB�M A CONTAMINA��O DO SOLO E DAS �GUAS DEVIDO AO EXCESSO DE NUTRIENTES LIXIVIADOS. COM ISSO, OBSERVA-SE QUE OS FERTILIZANTES DE LIBERA��O LENTA DE NITROG�NIO S�O UMA ALTERNATIVA MAIS ECON�MICA PARA A AGRICULTURA E MENOS AGRESSIVA AO MEIO AMBIENTE, POIS PODEM REDUZIR TAIS PERDAS. NESTE SENTIDO, O PRESENTE TRABALHO TEM COMO OBJETIVO PRODUZIR UM MATERIAL DE LIBERA��O LENTA DE NITROG�NIO ATRAV�S DO REVESTIMENTO DA CAULINI

THE NON-LINEAR SCIENCE IS A CENTRAL TOPIC COVERING SEVERAL INVESTIGATION AREAS, SUCH AS BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS. IN THE RST PART OF THIS THESIS, WE STUDIED THE NON-LINEARITY IN THE SCOPE OF CLASSICAL ELD THEORY. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE BASED ON STATIC SOLUTIONS IN (1, 1) SPACE-TIME DIMENSIONS, AND THEY ARE FOCUSED ON KINKS AND LUMPS DEFECTS. IN THE RELATED PROCEDURES, WE SHOW SEVERAL TECHNIQUES WHICH ALLOWED US TO DETERMINE NEW MODELS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS. THE MAIN MATHEMATICAL TOOL TO OBTAIN THESE RESULTS IS THE SO CALLED DEFORMATION METHOD, WHICH WAS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL PIECE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW EXTENSION METHOD. THIS METHOD PRESENTS THE DETERMINATION OF NEW TWO SCALAR ELDS MODELS FROM THE COUPLING BETWEEN TWO ONE SCALAR ELD SYSTEMS.

ABSTRACT BIOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION GENERATES PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY, BE IT DRIVEN BY NEUTRAL BIOGEOGRAPHIC (VARIANCE AND DISPERSAL) OR POPULATIONAL (DEMOGRAPHIC FLUCTUATION) OR EVEN ADAPTIVE PROCESSES MEDIATED BY NATURAL SELECTION (E.G., SELECTION ALONG ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS). WE UNDERTOOK A STUDY ON THE ECOLOGICAL AND PHYLOGEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF AN AMPHIBIAN WIDESPREAD IN THE THE SUBTROPICS OF SOUTH AMERICA THAT OCCURS IN THREE DISTINCT BIOMES. FIRSTLY, WE USED MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES TO TEST IF BIOCLIMATIC NICHE COMPONENTS OF H.PULCHELLUS INDICATED NICHE DIVERGENCE OR CONSERVATISM ALONG A SPATIALLY AUTOCORRELATED ECOLOGICAL GRADIENT.

THE VICTORY OF THE WORKERS PARTY IN THE 2002 ELECTIONS PROVIDED LULA'S ASCENSION TO THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND CREATED EXPECTATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION. TWELVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF GOVERNMENTS WITH NEOLIBERAL TENDENCIES HAD CAUSED THE AGGRAVATION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS, THE SUBMISSION OF THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY TO THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CAPITAL AND TO AN EXTERNAL POLITICS LINKED TO NORTHERN AMERICAN INTERESTS IN GENERAL. THE NUCLEAR POLICY IN THIS PERIOD REPRESENTED A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT SUBMISSION. DURING THE GOVERNMENT OF LULA, THERE WAS THE PRETENSION TO ESTABLISH A PROJECT THAT WOULD PROMOTE A BETTER INSERTION OF BRAZIL INTO AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM IN TRANSFORMATION, WITH THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE APPARENT DECADENCE OF THE NORTHERN AMERICAN POWER. ALBEIT THE CONTINUITY WITH THE PRECEDENT GOVERNMENTS OBSERVED IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF LULA, HIS EXTERNAL POLICIES SEEMED TO WALK TOWARDS ANOTHER DIRECTION, MORE INDEPENDENT AND ASSERTIV

THE FIELD OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY HAS EXPERIENCED A SHIFT OF PARADIGM WITH THE ADVENT OF SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCE DATA. THE MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY IS THE BRANCH OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY THAT EXAMINES THE HEREDITARY MOLECULAR DIFFERENCES, FOR INFORMATION ON THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ORGANISMS. PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES HAVE PROVEN TO BE IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR RESEARCH IN AREAS SUCH AS HUMAN EPIDEMIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. SEVERAL DISEASES ARE RELATED TO LIPID METABOLISM AND AN IMPORTANT PROTEIN INVOLVED IN THAT METABOLISM IS THE APOLIPOPROTEIN. APOLIPOPROTEINS REGULATE LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM AND DETERMINE THE EXCLUSIVE ROLES IN THE METABOLISM OF THESE LIPIDS. THEY FUNCTION IN THE TRANSPORT OF LIPIDS AS STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF LIPOPROTEIN PARTICLES, COFACTORS AND ENZYMES BY BINDING TO CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS. THE OCCURRENCE OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF APOLIPOPROTEINS TO BIND TO LIPIDS AND SEVERAL SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS ENABLED THE EMERGENCE OF A COM

CRI-DU-CHAT SYNDROME IS A RARE CHROMOSOMAL DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY A DELETION ON THE SHORT ARM OF CHROMOSOME 5. CLINICAL FEATURES OF THIS SYNDROME INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL IMPAIRMENT, DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS, WEAK CRY AND TYPICAL FACIAL DYSMORPHISM. THE POSITION AND SIZE OF THE DELETION HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE SEVERITY OF DISEASE AND TO THE LEVEL OF MENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AS WELL AS ITS PROGNOSIS. MOLECULAR STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE CRITICAL REGION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PHENOTYPE OF MONOSOMY 5P IS LOCATED BETWEEN 5P15.2-5P15.3, WHERE GENES FOR NEURONAL PROTEINS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO MENTAL RETARDATION, TO UNUSUAL CRY AND TO THE PHENOTYPICAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MAPPED.

THE GENUS ASTYANAX THAT BELONGS TO THE SUBFAMILY CHARACIDAE IS KNOWN TO COMPRISE THE FRESHWATER FISH POPULARLY NAMED AS LAMBARIS. CONSIDERING THE HIGH NUMBER OF SPECIES, LARGE DISTRIBUTION AND COMPLEX TAXONOMY, ASTYANAX IS ONE OF THE MOST QUESTIONABLE GENUS IN CHARACIDAE. DUE TO THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT GENETIC DIVERSITY, POPULATION STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONS OF THE SPECIES OF ASTYANAX ON THE RIVERS OF NORTHEAST BRAZIL, PARTICULARLY IN THE PARAGUA�U RIVER (CHAPADA DIAMANTINA � BAHIA), THERE IS A DIFFICULTY TO ESTABLISH THEIR TAXONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS.

OVER THE LAST DECADES THE CITIES EMERGED AND CONSOLIDATED IN A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THE RESTRUCTURING OF CAPITALISM AND GLOBALIZATION PRODUCTION. CITIES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY THE LOCUS OF THE MODERNIZATION AND THE SPACE REQUIRED FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION. IN ORDER TO LEGITIMIZE THE CITIES AS POLITICAL ACTORS, URBAN ENTERPRISES WERE CHOSEN AS THE NEW MANAGEMENT MODEL THAT HAS BEEN LARGELY ACCEPTED IN SEVERAL CITIES THAT ONLY URBAN MANAGEMENT BASED ON EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WOULD BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE URBAN CRISIS AND REPLACE COMPETITIVE CITIES IN THE GLOBAL FLOWS. ONE OF THE CITIES THAT HAS ADOPTED URBAN MANAGEMENT IS RIO DE JANEIRO, WHICH SINCE THE 90S THROUGH THE MAKING OF STRATEGIC PLANNING, HAS SOUGHT THEIR INCLUSION IN THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZATION OF CAPITALISM. FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS BEEN USED THE IMAGE OF THE OLYMPIC CITY, FRIENDLY AND RECEPTIVE TO THE BUSINESS AND TOURISM, BUT ABOVE ALL, HAS RENEWED ITS URBAN SPACE THROUGH VARIOUS PROJECTS AND INTERVENT

OCULAR MELANOMA TUMORS IN ADULTS, AND RETINOBLASTOMA IN CHILDREN, AMONG OTHERS, ARE THE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSED IN THE EYE REGION. THE RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ENUCLEATION. THE OPHTHALMIC BRACHYTHERAPY CONSISTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF A PLATE WITH SEEDS OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IN THE EYE OF A PATIENT TO TREAT THESE OCULAR TUMORS. CURRENTLY, THE RADIATION DOSE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE PATIENT IS PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS AND THE IRRADIATION TIME IS CALCULATED USING CALIBRATION CURVES PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PLATES. THE PATIENT DOSE ESTIMATION MAY ALSO BE PERFORMED BY SIMULATIONS, USING AN EXPOSURE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL. THESE MODELS ARE BASICALLY COMPOSED BY AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC PHANTOM, A MONTE CARLO CODE AND AN ALGORITHM TO SIMULATE THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCE.

ABORDAGENS ANTERIORES FORAM UTILIZADAS PARA OBTENC~AO DAS FREQU^ENCIAS DE DETERMINADOS SEGMENTOS DE NUCLEOTDEOS, CONSIDERADOS COMO PALAVRAS DE UM DADO TAMANHO, CONTIDOS NAS SEQU^ENCIAS. TAIS METODOS, INSPIRADOS EM ESTUDOS DEDICADOS AS PROPRIEDADES ESTATSTICAS DE DISTRIBUIC~AO DE PALAVRAS EM TEXTOS LINGUSTICOS E SEQU^ENCIAS SIMBOLICAS, PODEM SER CONSIDERADOS UMA ALTERNATIVA AS TECNICAS E ALGORITMOS DE ALINHAMENTO DE SEQU^ENCIAS, E T^EM SIDO BEM SUCEDIDOS NA DESCRIC~AO DE CARACTERSTICAS QUE PERMITEM INFERIR SIMILARIDADE E POSSVEIS CRITERIOS DE AGRUPAMENTOS DE ESPECIES, OU SEJA, A NIDADE BIOLOGICA ENTRE SEQU^ENCIAS DE DNA. ANTERIORMENTE, ESTA METODOLOGIA

"THIS DISSERTATION ANALYZES THE MEANING OF PACIFYING POLICE UNITS (UPP) AS A CONTROL TECHNIQUE INCORPORATED INTO SPACE, USING THE BACKDROP OF THE SOCIOPOLITICAL TISSUE OF SPACE FRAGMENTATION UNDERWAY IN THE CITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO, WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE FOUCALTIAN BIO-POWER, PROMOTES THE FORMATION OF UPP AS NEW SAFETY DEVICES GUARDS PUREBRED AND THUS CAN LEGITIMIZE STATE POWER. MOREOVER, THIS PAPER POINTS OUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SLUM TO THE CITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO AND THE REGULATION OF POWER WITHIN DURING ITS POST-UPP, IN PARTICULAR THE FORM OF PERFORMANCE OF THE MAIN REGULATORS OF THIS POWER: ARMED DRUG TRAFFICKERS, RESIDENTS AND POLICE. FINALLY, IT MEASURES THE DEGREE OF VIOLENCE IN SANTA MARTA BEFORE AND AFTER THE UPP, USING DATA FROM THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC SAFETY (ISP) AND INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED DURING THE RESEARCH TO ESTABLISH SOME LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF THIS NEW POLICY REGARDING VIOLENCE PREVENTION, USING THREE CATEGORIES OF ANALYSIS: REDISTRIBUTIVE
THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE LAGOON OF JACAREPAGU� AND THE OCCUPATION OF ITS OUTSKIRTS THROUGHOUT THE MULTI-TEMPORAL, CONTRIBUTING FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE LOWLAND OF JACAREPAGU�. THE ADOPTED METHODOLOGY SEEKED TO IDENTIFY THE PHYSICAL CHANGES OF THE ENVIRONMENT FROM 1980 S ON, THROUGH THE ELABORATION, COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF OCCUPATION MAPS AND THE USAGE OF SOILS RELATED TO THE YEARS OF 1984, 1992, 2001 AND 2010, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE WATER QUALITY OF THE LAGOON OF JACAREPAGUA, OF ITS DEPTH CONDITIONS, THE SIZE OF THE WATER MIRROR AND ITS RELATION TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THIS WAY, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PORTRAY WAYS OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL PROCESSES IN A GIVEN TIME-SPACE, AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH FUTURE TENDENCIES OF THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FROM TIME TO TIME THERE IS A REFUNCTIONALIZATION OF THE SPACE, WHICH REFLECTS NOT ONLY IN THE CONFORMATION OF THE MARGINAL SWAMPY TERRAINS, BUT ALSO IN THE PHYSICAL CON
